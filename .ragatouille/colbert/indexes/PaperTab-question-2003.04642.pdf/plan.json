While neural MRC systems gain popularity and achieve noticeable performance, issues are being raised with the methodology used to establish their performance, particularly concerning the data design of gold standards that are used to evaluate them. There is but a limited understanding of the challenges present in this data, which makes it hard to draw comparisons and formulate reliable hypotheses.",
                "There is but a limited understanding of the challenges present in this data, which makes it hard to draw comparisons and formulate reliable hypotheses. As a \ufb01rst step towards alleviating the problem, this paper proposes a unifying framework to systematically investigate the present linguistic features, required reasoning and background knowledge and factual correctness on one hand, and the presence of lexical cues as a lower bound for the requirement of understanding on the other hand. We propose a qualitative annotation schema for the \ufb01rst and a set of approximative metrics for the latter. In a \ufb01rst application of the framework, we analyse modern MRC gold standards and present our \ufb01ndings: the absence of features that contribute towards lexical ambiguity, the varying factual correctness of the expected answers and the presence of lexical cues, all of which potentially lower the reading comprehension complexity and quality of the evaluation data. Keywords: Machine Reading Comprehension, Question Answering, Evaluation Methodology, Annotation Schema 1. Introduction There is a recent spark of interest in the task of Question Answering (QA) over unstructured textual data, also re- ferred to as Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC).",
                "Keywords: Machine Reading Comprehension, Question Answering, Evaluation Methodology, Annotation Schema 1. Introduction There is a recent spark of interest in the task of Question Answering (QA) over unstructured textual data, also re- ferred to as Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). This is mostly due to wide-spread success of advances in various facets of deep learning related research, such as novel archi- tectures (Vaswani et al., 2017; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) that allow for ef\ufb01cient optimisation of neural networks consist- ing of multiple layers, hardware designed for deep learning purposes12 and software frameworks (Abadi et al., 2016; Paszke et al., 2017) that allow ef\ufb01cient development and testing of novel approaches. These factors enable re- searchers to produce models that are pre-trained on large scale corpora and provide contextualised word representa- tions (Peters et al., 2018) that are shown to be a vital com- ponent towards solutions for a variety of natural language understanding tasks, including MRC (Devlin et al., 2019)."
