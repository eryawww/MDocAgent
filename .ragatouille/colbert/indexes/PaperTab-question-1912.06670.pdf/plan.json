The most recent release includes 29 languages, and as of November 2019 there are a total of 38 languages collecting data. Over 50,000 individuals have participated so far, resulting in 2,500 hours of collected audio. To our knowledge this is the largest audio corpus in the public domain for speech recognition, both in terms of number of hours and number of languages. As an example use case for Common Voice, we present speech recognition experiments using Mozilla\u2019s DeepSpeech Speech-to-Text toolkit. By applying transfer learning from a source English model, we \ufb01nd an average Character Error Rate improvement of 5.99 \u00b1 5.48 for twelve target languages (German, French, Italian, Turkish, Catalan, Slovenian, Welsh, Irish, Breton, Tatar, Chuvash, and Kabyle).

Keywords: spoken corpus, Automatic Speech Recognition, low-resource languages 1. Introduction The Common Voice project1 is a response to the current state of affairs in speech technology, in which training data is either prohibitively expensive or unavailable for most languages (Roter, 2019). We believe that speech technol- ogy (like all technology) should be open and decentralized, and the Common Voice project achieves this goal via a mix of community building, open source tooling, and a permis- sive licensing scheme. The corpus is designed to organ- ically scale to new languages as community members use the provided tools to translate the interface, submit text sen- tences, and \ufb01nally record and validate voices in their new language 2. The project was started with an initial focus on English in July 2017 and then in June 2018 was made available for any language. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec- tion (2) we motivate Common Voice and review previous multilingual corpora.",
            "The project was started with an initial focus on English in July 2017 and then in June 2018 was made available for any language. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec- tion (2) we motivate Common Voice and review previous multilingual corpora. Next, in Section (3) we describe the recording and validation process used to create the corpus. Next, in Section (4) we describe the current contents of Common Voice, and lastly in Section (5) we show multi- lingual Automatic Speech Recognition experiments using the corpus. 2. Prior work Some notable multilingual speech corpora include Vox- Forge (VoxForge, 2019), Babel (Gales et al., 2014), and M- AILABS (M-AILABS, 2019). Even though the Babel cor- pus contains high-quality data from 22 minority languages, it is not released under an open license.",
            "Even though the Babel cor- pus contains high-quality data from 22 minority languages, it is not released under an open license. VoxForge is most similar to Common Voice in that it is community-driven, 1http:\/\/voice.mozilla.org 2https:\/\/discourse.mozilla.org\/t\/ readme-how-to-see-my-language-on-common-voice\/ 31530 multilingual (17 languages), and released under an open li- cense (GNU General Public License). However, the Vox- Forge does not have a sustainable data collection pipeline compared to Common Voice, and there is no data valida- tion step in place. M-AILABS data contains 9 language varieties with a modi\ufb01ed BSD 3-Clause License, however there is no community-driven aspect. Common Voice is a sustainable, open alternative to these projects which allows for collection of minority and majority languages alike. 3.

Using ei- ther the Common Voice website or iPhone app, contribu- tors record their voice by reading sentences displayed on the screen (see Figure (1)). The recordings are later ver- i\ufb01ed by other contributors using a simple voting system. Shown in Figure (2), this validation interface has contribu- tors mark <audio,transcript> pairs as being either correct (up-vote) or incorrect (down-vote). A maximum of three contributors will listen to any audio clip.3 If an <audio,transcript> pair \ufb01rst receives two up- votes, then the clip is marked as valid. If instead the clip \ufb01rst receives two down-votes, then it is marked as invalid. A contributor may switch between recording and validation as they wish. Only clips marked as valid are included in the of\ufb01cial train- ing, development, and testing sets for each language. Clips which did not receive enough votes to be validated or in- validated by the time of release are released as \u201cother\u201d.",

This ensures that contributors seen at train time are not seen at test time, which would skew results. Additionally, repetitions of text sentences are removed from the train, test, and development sets of the corpus.4 The number of clips is divided among the three datasets ac- cording to statistical power analyses. Given the total num- ber of validated clips in a language, the number of clips in the test set is equal to the number needed to achieve a con- \ufb01dence level of 99% with a margin of error of 1% relative to the number of clips in the training set.

These sentences make up the ini- tial text prompts for the languages in question. Any language community can gather additional sentences through the Sentence Collector9 taking advantage of auto- matic validation mechanisms such as checks for sentence length, foreign alphabets, and numbers. Every sentence submitted through the Sentence Collector needs to be ap- proved by two out of three reviewers, leading to a weekly export of new sentences into the Common Voice database. Once the website is translated and at least 5,000 sentences have been added, the language is enabled for voice record- ings. 5.

These results represent work on an internal version of Com- mon Voice from February 2019. The current corpus con- tains more languages and more data per language. These experiments use an End-to-End Transfer Learning approach which bypasses the need for linguistic resources or domain expertise (Meyer, 2019). Certain layers are copied from a pre-trained English source model, new layers are initialized for a target language, the old and new layers are stitched together, and all layers are \ufb01ne-tuned via gradi- ent descent. 5.1.
