        "WORD EMBEDDING BASED NEW CORPUS FOR LOW-RESOURCED LANGUAGE: SINDHI A PREPRINT Wazir Ali, Jay Kumar, Junyu Lu, Zenglin Xu School of Computer Science and Engineering University of Electronic Science and Technology of China January 20, 2022 ABSTRACT Representing words and phrases into dense vectors of real numbers which encode semantic and syntactic properties is a vital constituent in natural language processing (NLP). The success of neural network (NN) models in NLP largely rely on such dense word representations learned on the large unlabeled corpus. Sindhi is one of the rich morphological language, spoken by large population in Pakistan and India lacks corpora which plays an essential role of a test-bed for generating word embeddings and developing language independent NLP systems. In this paper, a large corpus of more than 61 million words is developed for low-resourced Sindhi language for training neural word embeddings. The corpus is acquired from multiple web-resources using web-scrappy. Due to the unavailability of open source preprocessing tools for Sindhi, the prepossessing of such large corpus becomes a challenging problem specially cleaning of noisy data extracted from web resources.",
        "The corpus is acquired from multiple web-resources using web-scrappy. Due to the unavailability of open source preprocessing tools for Sindhi, the prepossessing of such large corpus becomes a challenging problem specially cleaning of noisy data extracted from web resources. Therefore, a preprocessing pipeline is employed for the \ufb01ltration of noisy text. Afterwards, the cleaned vocabulary is utilized for training Sindhi word embeddings with state-of-the-art GloVe, Skip-Gram (SG), and Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) word2vec algorithms. The intrinsic evaluation approach of cosine similarity matrix and WordSim-353 are employed for the evaluation of generated Sindhi word embeddings. Moreover, we compare the proposed word embeddings with recently revealed Sindhi fastText (SdfastText) word representations. Our intrinsic evaluation results demonstrate the high quality of our generated Sindhi word embeddings using SG, CBoW, and GloVe as compare to SdfastText word representations.

        "Keywords Corpus acquisition \u00b7 Sindhi language \u00b7 Neural networks \u00b7 Word embeddings \u00b7 Continuous Bag of Words \u00b7 Skip gram \u00b7 GloVe 1 Introduction Sindhi is a rich morphological, mutltiscript, and multidilectal language. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family [1], with signi\ufb01cant cultural and historical background. Presently, it is recognized as is an of\ufb01cial language [2] in Sindh province of Pakistan, also being taught as a compulsory subject in Schools and colleges. Sindhi is also recognized as one of the national languages in India. Ulhasnagar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra are the largest Indian regions of Sindhi native speakers. It is also spoken in other countries except for Pakistan and India, where native Sindhi speakers have migrated, such as America, Canada, Hong Kong, British, Singapore, Tanzania, Philippines, Kenya, Uganda, and South, and East Africa. Sindhi has rich morphological structure [3] due to a large number of homogeneous words. Historically, it was written in multiple writing systems, which differ from each other in terms of orthography and morphology."
