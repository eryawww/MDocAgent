            "While EHRs contain medical billing codes that aim to represent the conditions and treatments patients may have, much of the information is only present in the patient notes. Therefore, it is critical to develop robust algorithms to infer patients\u2019 conditions and treatments from their written notes. In this paper, we introduce a dataset for patient phenotyping, a task that is de\ufb01ned as the identi\ufb01cation of whether a patient has a given medical condition (also referred to as clinical indication or phenotype) based on their patient note. Nursing Progress Notes and Discharge Summaries from the Intensive Care Unit of a large tertiary care hospital were manually annotated for the presence of several high-context phenotypes relevant to treatment and risk of re-hospitalization. This dataset contains 1102 Discharge Summaries and 1000 Nursing Progress Notes. Each Discharge Summary and Progress Note has been annotated by at least two expert human annotators (one clinical researcher and one resident physician). Annotated phenotypes include treatment non-adherence, chronic pain, advanced\/metastatic cancer, as well as 10 other phenotypes.",

Introduction and Related Work With the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), medical data are being generated and stored dig- itally in vast quantities (J. Henry and Patel, 2016). While much EHR data are structured and amenable to analysis, there appears to be limited homogeneity in data complete- ness and quality (Weiskopf and Weng, 2013), and it is esti- mated that the majority of healthcare data are being gener- ated in unstructured, text-based format (Murdoch and Det- sky, 2013).",
            "The generation and storage of these unstruc- tured data come concurrently with policy initiatives that seek to utilize preventative measures to reduce hospital ad- mission and readmission (Zuckerman et al., 2016). Chronic illnesses, behavioral factors, and social determi- nants of health are known to be associated with higher risks of hospital readmission, (Virapongse and Misky, 2018) and though behavioral factors and social determinants of health are often determined at the point of care, their identi\ufb01cation may not always be curated in structured format within the EHR in the same manner that other factors associated with routine patient history taking and physical examination are (Lai et al., 2016). Identifying these patient attributes within EHRs in a reliable manner has the potential to reveal ac- tionable associations which otherwise may remain poorly de\ufb01ned. As EHRs act to streamline the healthcare administration process, much of the data collected and stored in structured format may be those data most relevant to reimbursement and billing, and may not necessarily be those data which were most relevant during the clinical encounter.",
            "As EHRs act to streamline the healthcare administration process, much of the data collected and stored in structured format may be those data most relevant to reimbursement and billing, and may not necessarily be those data which were most relevant during the clinical encounter. For ex- ample, a diabetic patient who does not adhere to an insulin treatment regimen and who thereafter presents to the hospi- tal with symptoms indicating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) will be treated and considered administratively as an in- dividual presenting with DKA, though that medical emer- gency may have been secondary to non-adherence to the initial treatment regimen in the setting of diabetes. In this instance, any retrospective study analyzing only the struc- arXiv:2003.03044v1  [cs.CL]  6 Mar 2020",
            "tured data from many similarly selected clinical encounters will necessarily then underestimate the effect of treatment non-adherence with respect to hospital admissions. While this form of high context information may not be found in the structured EHR data, it may be accessible in patient notes, including nursing progress notes and dis- charge summaries, particularly through the utilization of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. (Chan et al., 2019), (Moon et al., 2019) Given progress in NLP meth- ods, we sought to address the issue of unstructured clinical text by de\ufb01ning and annotating clinical phenotypes in text which may otherwise be prohibitively dif\ufb01cult to discern in the structured data associated with the text entry. For this task, we chose the notes present in the publicly available MIMIC database (Johnson et al., 2016). Given the MIMIC database as substrate and the afore- mentioned policy initiatives to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions, as well as the goal of providing structure to text, we elected to focus on patients who were frequently readmitted to the ICU (Ryan et al., 2015).",
            "Given the MIMIC database as substrate and the afore- mentioned policy initiatives to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions, as well as the goal of providing structure to text, we elected to focus on patients who were frequently readmitted to the ICU (Ryan et al., 2015). In particular, a patient who is admitted to the ICU more than three times in a single year. By de\ufb01ning our cohort in this way we sought to ensure we were able to capture those characteris- tics unique to the cohort in a manner which may yield ac- tionable intelligence on interventions to assist this patient population. 2. Data Characteristics We have created a dataset of discharge summaries and nurs- ing notes, all in the English language, with a focus on fre- quently readmitted patients, labeled with 15 clinical patient phenotypes believed to be associated with risk of recurrent Intensive Care Unit (ICU) readmission per our domain ex- perts (co-authors LAC, PAT, DAG) as well as the litera- ture.",

These variables are suf\ufb01cient to use the data set alone, or to join it to the MIMIC-III database by Subject Identi\ufb01er or Hospital Admission Identi\ufb01er for ad- ditional patient-level or admission-level data, respectively. The MIMIC database (Johnson et al., 2016) was utilized to extract Subject Identi\ufb01ers, Hospital Admission Identi\ufb01ers, and Note Text.",
            "The MIMIC database (Johnson et al., 2016) was utilized to extract Subject Identi\ufb01ers, Hospital Admission Identi\ufb01ers, and Note Text. Annotated discharge summaries had a median token count of 1417.50 (Q1-Q3: 1046.75 - 1926.00) with a vocabulary of 26454 unique tokens, while nursing notes had a me- dian count of 208 (Q1-Q3: 120 - 312) with a vocabulary of 12865 unique tokens. Table 1 de\ufb01nes each of the considered clinical patient phe- notypes. Table 2 counts the occurrences of these pheno- types across patient notes and Figure 1 contains the cor- responding correlation matrix. Lastly, Table 3 presents an overview of some descriptive statistics on the patient notes\u2019 lengths. 3. Methods Clinical researchers teamed with junior medical residents in collaboration with more senior intensive care physicians to carry out text annotation over the period of one year (Wu et al., 2018).

            "Methods Clinical researchers teamed with junior medical residents in collaboration with more senior intensive care physicians to carry out text annotation over the period of one year (Wu et al., 2018). Operators were grouped to facilitate the anno- tation of notes in duplicate, allowing for cases of disagree- ment between operators. The operators within each team were instructed to work independently on note annotation. Clinical texts were annotated in batches which were time- stamped on their day of creation, when both operators in a team completed annotation of a batch, a new batch was created and transferred to them. Two groups (group 1: co-authors ETM & JTW; group 2: co-authors JW & JF) of two operator pairs of one clini- cal researcher and one resident physician (who had previ- ously taken the MCAT R \u20dd) \ufb01rst annotated nursing notes and then discharge summaries. Everyone was \ufb01rst trained on the high-context phenotypes to look for as well as their def- initions by going through a number of notes in a group.",
            "Everyone was \ufb01rst trained on the high-context phenotypes to look for as well as their def- initions by going through a number of notes in a group. A total of 13 phenotypes were considered for annotation, and the label \u201cunsure\u201d was used to indicate that an operator would like to seek assistance determining the presence of an phenotype from a more senior physician. Annotations for phenotypes required explicit text in the note indicating the phenotype, but as a result of the complexity of certain phenotypes there was no speci\ufb01c dictionary of terms, or or- der in which the terms appeared, required for a phenotype to be considered present. 4. Limitations There exist a few limitations to this database. These data are unique to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), and models resulting from these data may not generalize to notes generated at other hospitals. Admis- sions to hospitals not associated with BIDMC will not have been captured, and generalizability is limited due to the limited geographic distribution of patients which present to the hospital.",
            "Admis- sions to hospitals not associated with BIDMC will not have been captured, and generalizability is limited due to the limited geographic distribution of patients which present to the hospital. We welcome opportunities to continue to expand this dataset with additional phenotypes sought in the unstruc- tured text, patient subsets, and text originating from differ- ent sources, with the goal of expanding the utility of NLP methods to further structure patient note text for retrospec- tive analyses. 5. Technical Validation All statistics and tabulations were generated and performed with R Statistical Software version 3.5.2. (R Core Team, 2018) Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) was calculated for each phenotype and pair of annotators for which precisely two note annotations were recorded.

            "Conclusion In this paper we have presented a new dataset containing discharge summaries and nursing progress notes, focusing on frequently readmitted patients and high-context social determinants of health, and originating from a large tertiary care hospital. Each patient note was annotated by at least one clinical researcher and one resident physician for 13 high-context patient phenotypes. Phenotype de\ufb01nitions, dataset distribution, patient note statistics, inter-operator error, and the results of baseline models were reported to demonstrate that the dataset is well-suited for the development of both rule-based and sta- tistical models for patient phenotyping. We hope that the release of this dataset will accelerate the development of algorithms for patient phenotyping, which in turn would signi\ufb01cantly help medical research progress faster. 9.
