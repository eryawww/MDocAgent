Through a large scale human evalua- tion study of table-to-text models for WikiBio, we show that PARENT correlates with human judgments better than existing text generation metrics.

For text generation tasks, the only gold standard metric is to show the output to humans for judg- ing its quality, but this is too expensive to apply \u2217Work done during an internship at Google.",
  "For text generation tasks, the only gold standard metric is to show the output to humans for judg- ing its quality, but this is too expensive to apply \u2217Work done during an internship at Google. 1Code and Data: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ ~bdhingra/pages/parent.html repeatedly anytime small modi\ufb01cations are made to a system. Hence, automatic metrics that com- pare the generated text to one or more reference texts are routinely used to compare models (Ban- galore et al., 2000). For table-to-text generation, automatic evaluation has largely relied on BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004). The underlying assumption behind these metrics is that the reference text is gold-standard, i.e., it is the ideal target text that a system should gener- ate. In practice, however, when datasets are col- lected automatically and heuristically, the refer- ence texts are often not ideal. Figure 1 shows an example from the WikiBio dataset (Lebret et al., 2016).",
  "In practice, however, when datasets are col- lected automatically and heuristically, the refer- ence texts are often not ideal. Figure 1 shows an example from the WikiBio dataset (Lebret et al., 2016). Here the reference contains extra informa- tion which no system can be expected to produce given only the associated table. We call such ref- erence texts divergent from the table. We show that existing automatic metrics, in- cluding BLEU, correlate poorly with human judg- ments when the evaluation sets contain divergent references (\u00a75.4). For many table-to-text genera- tion tasks, the tables themselves are in a pseudo- natural language format (e.g., WikiBio, WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017), and E2E-NLG (Du\u0161ek et al., 2019)). In such cases we propose to compare the generated text to the underlying table as well to improve evaluation. We develop a new metric, PARENT (Precision And Recall of Entailed N- grams from the Table) (\u00a73).",
  "In such cases we propose to compare the generated text to the underlying table as well to improve evaluation. We develop a new metric, PARENT (Precision And Recall of Entailed N- grams from the Table) (\u00a73). When computing pre- cision, PARENT effectively uses a union of the reference and the table, to reward correct informa- tion missing from the reference. When computing recall, it uses an intersection of the reference and the table, to ignore extra incorrect information in the reference. The union and intersection are com- puted with the help of an entailment model to de- cide if a text n-gram is entailed by the table.2 We 2Here \u201centailed\u201d means can be reasonably inferred from arXiv:1906.01081v1  [cs.CL]  3 Jun 2019",

  "2 Table-to-Text Generation We brie\ufb02y review the task of generating natu- ral language descriptions of semi-structured data, which we refer to as tables henceforth (Barzilay the corresponding table. In practice, we use simple lexical entailment models to determine this. and Lapata, 2005; Liang et al., 2009). Tables can be expressed as set of records T = {rk}K k=1, where each record is a tuple (entity, attribute, value). When all the records are about the same entity, we can truncate the records to (attribute, value) pairs. For example, for the table in Figure 1, the records are {(Birth Name, Michael Dahlquist), (Born, December 22 1965), ...}. The task is to gen- erate a text G which summarizes the records in a \ufb02uent and grammatical manner.3 For training and evaluation we further assume that we have a ref- erence description R available for each table.",
  "The task is to gen- erate a text G which summarizes the records in a \ufb02uent and grammatical manner.3 For training and evaluation we further assume that we have a ref- erence description R available for each table. We let DM = {(T i, Ri, Gi)}N i=1 denote an evaluation set of tables, references and texts generated from a model M, and Ri n, Gi n denote the collection of n-grams of order n in Ri and Gi, respectively. We use #Rin(g) to denote the count of n-gram g in Ri n, and #Gin,Rin(g) to denote the minimum of its counts in Ri n and Gi n. Our goal is to assign a score to the model, which correlates highly with human judgments of the quality of that model. Divergent References.

  "Divergent References. In this paper we are in- terested in the case where reference texts diverge from the tables. In Figure 1, the reference, though technically correct and \ufb02uent, mentions informa- tion which cannot be gleaned from the associ- ated table. It also fails to mention useful infor- mation which a generation system might correctly include (e.g. candidate 3 in the \ufb01gure). We call such references divergent from the associated ta- ble. This phenomenon is quite common \u2013 in Wik- iBio we found that 62% of the references men- tion extra information (\u00a75.5). Divergence is com- mon in human-curated translation datasets as well (Carpuat et al., 2017; Vyas et al., 2018). How does divergence affect automatic evalua- 3In some cases the system is expected to summarize all the records (e.g. WebNLG); in others the system is expected to only summarize the salient records (e.g. WikiBio).",
  "tion? As a motivating example, consider the three candidate generations shown in Figure 1. Clearly, candidate 1 is the worst since it \u201challucinates\u201d false information, and candidate 3 is the best since it is correct and mentions more information than candidate 2. However, BLEU and ROUGE, which only compare the candidates to the reference, pe- nalize candidate 3 for both excluding the divergent information in the reference (in red) and includ- ing correct information from the table (in green).4 PARENT, which compares to both the table and reference, correctly ranks the three candidates. 3 PARENT PARENT evaluates each instance (T i, Ri, Gi) separately, by computing the precision and recall of Gi against both T i and Ri. Entailment Probability. The table is in a semi- structured form, and hence not directly compa- rable to the unstructured generated or reference texts. To bridge this gap, we introduce the notion of entailment probability, which we de\ufb01ne as the probability that the presence of an n-gram g in a text is \u201ccorrect\u201d given the associated table.",
  "To bridge this gap, we introduce the notion of entailment probability, which we de\ufb01ne as the probability that the presence of an n-gram g in a text is \u201ccorrect\u201d given the associated table. We de- note this probability as w(g) = Pr(g \u21d0T i). Es- timating this probability is in itself a challenging language understanding task, since the informa- tion in the table may be expressed in varied forms in text. Here, we describe two simple models of lexical entailment, inspired by work on the Recog- nizing Textual Entailment Challenge (Dagan et al., 2006). We found these simple models to be effec- tive; while more sophisticated models may be used if there are complex inferences between the table and text, they are beyond the scope of this paper. 1. Word Overlap Model: Let \u00afT i denote all the lexical items present in the table T i, including both attribute names and their values. Then, w(g) = Pn j=1 1(gj \u2208\u00afT i)/n, where n is the length of g, and gj is the jth token in g.",
  "Then, w(g) = Pn j=1 1(gj \u2208\u00afT i)/n, where n is the length of g, and gj is the jth token in g. 2. Co-occurrence Model: (Glickman and Dagan, 2005) Originally proposed for the RTE task, this model computes the probability of a term gj in the n-gram being entailed by the table as the maximum of its probabilities of being en- 4BLEU is usually computed at the corpus-level, however here we show its value for a single sentence purely for illus- tration purposes.

(1) Pr(gj \u21d0v) is estimated using co-occurrence counts from a training set of table-reference pairs. Then the overall probability of the n- gram being entailed is taken as the geometric average w(g) = \u0010Qn j=1 Pr(gj \u21d0T i) \u00111/n .5 We note that these models are not sensitive to paraphrases between the table and text. For tasks where this is important, embedding-based similar- ities may be used, but those are beyond the scope of this paper. Next we discuss how to compute the precision and recall of the generation. Entailed Precision. When computing precision, we want to check what fraction of the n-grams in Gi n are correct. We consider an n-gram g to be correct either if it occurs in the reference Ri n 6, or if it has a high probability of being entailed by the table (i.e. w(g) is high).",
  "We consider an n-gram g to be correct either if it occurs in the reference Ri n 6, or if it has a high probability of being entailed by the table (i.e. w(g) is high). Let Pr(g \u2208Ri n) = #Gin,Rin(g) #Gin(g) denote the probability that an n-gram in Gi n also appears in Ri n. Then, the entailed pre- cision En p for n-grams of order n is given by: En p = P g\u2208Gin \u0002 Pr(g \u2208Ri n) + Pr(g /\u2208Ri n)w(g) \u0003 #Gin(g) P g\u2208Gin #Gin(g) , = P g\u2208Gin #Gin(g)w(g) + #Gin,Rin(g)[1 \u2212w(g)] P g\u2208Gin #Gin(g) . (2) In words, an n-gram receives a reward of 1 if it appears in the reference, with probability Pr(g \u2208 Ri n), and otherwise it receives a reward of w(g).",
  "(2) In words, an n-gram receives a reward of 1 if it appears in the reference, with probability Pr(g \u2208 Ri n), and otherwise it receives a reward of w(g). Both numerator and denominator are weighted by the count of the n-gram in Gi n. Pr(g \u2208Ri n) re- wards an n-gram for appearing as many times as it appears in the reference, not more. We combine precisions for n-gram orders 1-4 using a geometric 5Glickman and Dagan (2005) used a product instead of geometric mean. Here we use a geometric mean to ensure that n-grams of different lengths have comparable probabili- ties of being entailed. 6It is unlikely that an automated system produces the same extra n-gram as present in the reference, thus a match with the reference n-gram is considered positive. For example, in Figure 1, it is highly unlikely that a system would produce \u201cSilkworm\u201d when it is not present in the table.",
  "average, similar to BLEU: Ep = exp  4 X n=1 1 4 log En p ! (3) Entailed Recall. We compute recall against both the reference (Er(Ri)), to ensure proper sen- tence structure in the generated text, and the table (Er(T i)), to ensure that texts which mention more information from the table get higher scores (e.g. candidate 3 in Figure 1). These are combined us- ing a geometric average: Er = Er(Ri)(1\u2212\u03bb)Er(T i)\u03bb (4) The parameter \u03bb trades-off how much the gener- ated text should match the reference, versus how much it should cover information from the table. The geometric average, which acts as an AND op- eration, ensures that the overall recall is high only when both the components are high. We found this necessary to assign low scores to bad systems which, for example, copy values from the table without phrasing them in natural language. When computing Er(Ri), divergent references will have n-grams with low w(g).",

When computing Er(Ri), divergent references will have n-grams with low w(g).

(5) Similar to precision, we combine recalls for n = 1-4 using a geometric average to get Er(Ri). For computing Er(T i), note that a table is a set of records T i = {rk}K k=1. For a record rk, let \u00afrk denote its string value (such as \u201cMichael Dahlquist\u201d or \u201cDecember 22 1965\u201d).",

Then: Er(T i) = 1 K K X k=1 1 |\u00afrk|LCS(\u00afrk, Gi), (6) where \u00afrk denotes the number of tokens in the value string, and LCS(x, y) is the length of the longest common subsequence between x and y. The LCS function, borrowed from ROUGE, ensures that en- tity names in \u00afrk appear in the same order in the text as the table. Higher values of Er(T i) denote that more records are likely to be mentioned in Gi. The entailed precision and recall are combined into an F-score to give the PARENT metric for one instance.",
  "Higher values of Er(T i) denote that more records are likely to be mentioned in Gi. The entailed precision and recall are combined into an F-score to give the PARENT metric for one instance. The system-level PARENT score for a model M is the average of instance level PARENT scores across the evaluation set: PARENT(M) = 1 N N X i=1 PARENT(Gi, Ri, T i) (7) Smoothing & Multiple References. The dan- ger with geometric averages is that if any of the components being averaged become 0, the average will also be 0. Hence, we adopt a smoothing tech- nique from Chen and Cherry (2014) that assigns a small positive value \u03f5 to any of En p , En r (Ri) and Er(T i) which are 0. When multiple references are available for a table, we compute PARENT against each reference and take the maximum as its overall score, similar to METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014).",

Choosing \u03bb and \u03f5. To set the value of \u03bb we can tune it to maximize the correlation of the metric with human judgments, when such data is avail- able. When such data is not available, we can use the recall of the reference against the table, using Eq. 6, as the value of 1 \u2212\u03bb. The intuition here is that if the recall of the reference against the table is high, it already covers most of the information, and we can assign it a high weight in Eq. 4. This leads to a separate value of \u03bb automatically set for each instance.7 \u03f5 is set to 10\u22125 for all experiments. 4 Evaluation via Information Extraction Wiseman et al.

  "(2017) proposed to use an auxil- iary model, trained to extract structured records from text, for evaluation. However, the extrac- tion model presented in that work is limited to the closed-domain setting of basketball game tables and summaries. In particular, they assume that each table has exactly the same set of attributes for each entity, and that the entities can be identi\ufb01ed in the text via string matching. These assumptions are not valid for the open-domain WikiBio dataset, and hence we train our own extraction model to replicate their evaluation scheme. Our extraction system is a pointer-generator network (See et al., 2017), which learns to produce a linearized version of the table from the text.8 The network learns which attributes need to be popu- lated in the output table, along with their values. 7For WikiBio, on average \u03bb = 0.6 using this heuristic. 8 All (attribute, value) pairs are merged into 1 long string using special separator tokens between them.",
  "It is trained on the training set of WikiBio. At test time we parsed the output strings into a set of (at- tribute, value) tuples and compare it to the ground truth table. The F-score of this text-to-table system was 35.1%, which is comparable to other chal- lenging open-domain settings (Huang et al., 2017). More details are included in the Appendix A.1. Given this information extraction system, we consider the following metrics for evaluation, along the lines of Wiseman et al. (2017). Con- tent Selection (CS): F-score for the (attribute, value) pairs extracted from the generated text compared to those extracted from the reference. Relation Generation (RG): Precision for the (at- tribute, value) pairs extracted from the generated text compared to those in the ground truth table. RG-F: Since our task emphasizes the recall of in- formation from the table as well, we consider an- other variant which computes the F-score of the extracted pairs to those in the table. We omit the content ordering metric, since our extraction sys- tem does not align records to the input text.",

Speci\ufb01cally, given l models M1, . . . , Ml, and their outputs on an evaluation set, we show these generated texts to humans to judge their quality, and obtain aggregated human evaluation scores for all the models, \u00afh = (h1, . . . , hl) (\u00a75.2).

In \u00a75.6 we also present results on the data released as part of the WebNLG challenge. We developed several models of varying qual- ity for generating text from the tables in WikiBio. This gives us a diverse set of outputs to evaluate the automatic metrics on.

All neural models were trained on the WikiBio training set. Training details and sample outputs are included in Appendices A.2 & A.3. We divide these models into two categories and measure correlation separately for both the cat- egories. The \ufb01rst category, WikiBio-Systems, includes one model each from the four families listed in Table 1. This category tests whether a metric can be used to compare different model families with a large variation in the quality of their outputs. The second category, WikiBio- Hyperparams, includes 13 different hyperparam- eter settings of PG-Net (See et al., 2017), which was the best performing system overall. 9 of these were obtained by varying the beam size and length normalization penalty of the decoder network (Wu et al., 2016), and the remaining 4 were obtained by re-scoring beams of size 8 with the information extraction model described in \u00a74.",

Here we are test- ing whether a metric can be used to compare simi- lar systems with a small variation in performance. This is an important use-case as metrics are often used to tune hyperparameters of a model. 5.2 Human Evaluation We collected human judgments on the quality of the 16 models trained for WikiBio, plus the refer- ence texts. Workers on a crowd-sourcing platform, pro\ufb01cient in English, were shown a table with pairs of generated texts, or a generated text and the reference, and asked to select the one they prefer.

However, for mea- suring correlation the comparisons need to be ag- gregated into real-valued scores, \u00afh = (h1, . . . , hl), for each of the l = 16 models. For this, we use Thurstone\u2019s method (Tsukida and Gupta, 2011), which assigns a score to each model based on how many times it was preferred over an alternative. The data collection was performed separately for models in the WikiBio-Systems and WikiBio- Hyperparams categories. 1100 tables were sam- pled from the development set, and for each table we got 8 different sentence pairs annotated across the two categories, resulting in a total of 8800 pair- wise comparisons. Each pair was judged by one worker only which means there may be noise at the instance-level, but the aggregated system-level scores had low variance (cf. Table 1). In total around 500 different workers were involved in the annotation.",

Text & Table: We compare a variant of BLEU, denoted as BLEU-T, where the values from the table are used as additional references. BLEU- T draws inspiration from iBLEU (Sun and Zhou, 2012) but instead rewards n-grams which match the table rather than penalizing them.",

  "In the hyperparams cat- egory, these are often negative, implying that tun- ing models based on these may lead to selecting worse models. BLEU performs the best among these, and adding n-grams from the table as refer- ences improves this further (BLEU-T). Among the extractive evaluation metrics, CS, which also only relies on the reference, has poor correlation in the hyperparams category. RG-F, and both variants of the PARENT metric achieve the highest correlation for both settings. There is no signi\ufb01cant difference among these for the hy- perparams category, but for systems, PARENT-W is signi\ufb01cantly better than the other two.

Effect of Divergence. To study the correlation as we vary the number of divergent references, we also collected binary labels from workers for whether a reference is entailed by the correspond- ing table. We de\ufb01ne a reference as entailed when it mentions only information which can be inferred from the table. Each table and reference pair was judged by 3 independent workers, and we used the majority vote as the label for that pair. Overall, only 38% of the references were labeled as en- tailed by the table. Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba was 0.30, which in- dicates a fair agreement. We found the workers sometimes disagreed on what information can be reasonably entailed by the table.

Figure 4 shows the correlations as we vary the percent of entailed examples in the evaluation set of WikiBio. Each point is obtained by \ufb01xing the desired proportion of entailed examples, and sam- pling subsets from the full set which satisfy this proportion. PARENT and RG-F remain stable and show a high correlation across the entire range, whereas BLEU and BLEU-T vary a lot. In the hy- perparams category, the latter two have the worst correlation when the evaluation set contains only entailed examples, which may seem surprising. However, on closer examination we found that this subset tends to omit a lot of information from the tables. Systems which produce more information than these references are penalized by BLEU, but not in the human evaluation. PARENT overcomes 10The trends were similar for PARENT-C.",

In Table 3 we show the average accuracy of the met- rics in making the same judgments as humans be- tween pairs of generated texts. Both variants of PARENT are signi\ufb01cantly better than the other metrics, however the best accuracy is only 60% for the binary task.

  "We report the corre- lation of several metrics with these ratings in Ta- ble 4.12 Both variants of PARENT are either com- petitive or better than the other metrics in terms of the average correlation to all three aspects. This shows that PARENT is applicable for high quality references as well. While BLEU has the highest correlation for the grammar and \ufb02uency aspects, PARENT does best for semantics. This suggests that the inclusion of source tables into the evaluation orients the metric more towards measuring the \ufb01delity of the content of the generation. A similar trend is seen compar- ing BLEU and BLEU-T. As modern neural text generation systems are typically very \ufb02uent, mea- suring their \ufb01delity is of increasing importance. Between the two entailment models, PARENT- C is better due to its higher correlation with the grammaticality and \ufb02uency aspects. Distribution of \u03bb.

  "The only consensus from these studies seems to be that no single metric is suitable across all tasks. A recurring theme is that metrics like BLEU and NIST (Doddington, 2002) are not suit- able for judging content quality in NLG. Recently, Novikova et al. (2017a) did a comprehensive study of several metrics on the outputs of state-of-the-art NLG systems, and found that while they showed acceptable correlation with human judgments at the system level, they failed to show any correla- tion at the sentence level. Ours is the \ufb01rst study which checks the quality of metrics when table- to-text references are divergent. We show that in this case even system level correlations can be un- reliable. Hallucination (Rohrbach et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018) refers to when an NLG system generates text which mentions extra information than what is present in the source from which it is generated. Divergence can be viewed as hallucination in the reference text itself. PARENT deals with halluci- nation by discounting n-grams which do not over- lap with either the reference or the table.",
  "Divergence can be viewed as hallucination in the reference text itself. PARENT deals with halluci- nation by discounting n-grams which do not over- lap with either the reference or the table. PARENT draws inspiration from iBLEU (Sun and Zhou, 2012), a metric for evaluating para- phrase generation, which compares the generated text to both the source text and the reference. While iBLEU penalizes texts which match the source, here we reward such texts since our task values accuracy of generated text more than the need for paraphrasing the tabular content (Liu et al., 2010). Similar to SARI for text simpli\ufb01ca- tion (Xu et al., 2016) and Q-BLEU for question generation (Nema and Khapra, 2018), PARENT falls under the category of task-speci\ufb01c metrics. 7 Conclusions We study the automatic evaluation of table-to-text systems when the references diverge from the ta- ble. We propose a new metric, PARENT, which shows the highest correlation with humans across a range of settings with divergent references in WikiBio.",

A Appendices A.1 Information Extraction System For evaluation via information extraction (Wise- man et al., 2017) we train a model for WikiBio which accepts text as input and generates a table as the output. Tables in WikiBio are open-domain, without any \ufb01xed schema for which attributes may be present or absent in an instance.

  "Precision Recall F-score 0.428 0.310 0.351 Table 5: Performance of the Information Extraction system. employ the Pointer-Generator Network (PG-Net) (See et al., 2017) for this purpose. Speci\ufb01cally, we use a sequence-to-sequence model, whose encoder and decoder are both single-layer bi-directional LSTMs. The decoder is augmented with an at- tention mechanism over the states of the encoder. Further, it also uses a copy mechanism to option- ally copy tokens directly from the source text. We do not use the coverage mechanism of See et al. (2017) since that is speci\ufb01c to the task of sum- marization they study. The decoder is trained to produce a linearized version of the table where the rows and columns are \ufb02attened into a sequence, and separate by special tokens. Figure 6 shows an example. Clearly, since the references are divergent, the model cannot be expected to produce the entire ta- ble, and we see some false information being hal- lucinated after training.",
  "Figure 6 shows an example. Clearly, since the references are divergent, the model cannot be expected to produce the entire ta- ble, and we see some false information being hal- lucinated after training. Nevertheless, as we show in \u00a75.4, this system can be used for evaluating gen- erated texts. After training, we can parse the out- put sequence along the special tokens <R> and <C> to get a set of (attribute, value) pairs. Ta- ble 5 shows the precision, recall and F-score of these extracted pairs against the ground truth ta- bles, where the attributes and values are compared using an exact string match. A.2 Hyperparameters After tuning we found the same set of hyperpa- rameters to work well for both the table-to-text PG-Net, and the inverse information extraction PG-Net.

  "was set to 200. The input and output vocabularies were set to 50000 most common words in the cor- pus, with additional special symbols for table at- tribute names (such as \u201cbirth-date\u201d). The embed- dings of the tokens in the vocabulary were initial- ized with Glove (Pennington et al., 2014). Learn- ing rate of 0.0003 was used during training, with the Adam optimizer, and a dropout of 0.2 was also applied to the outputs of the biLSTM. Mod- els were trained till the loss on the dev set stopped dropping. Maximum length of a decoded text was set to 40 tokens, and that of the tables was set to 120 tokens. Various beam sizes and length nor- malization penalties were applied for the table-to- text system, which are listed in the main paper. For the information extraction system, we found a beam size of 8 and no length penalty to produce the highest F-score on the dev set. A.3 Sample Outputs Table 6 shows some sample references and the cor- responding predictions from the best performing model, PG-Net for WikiBio."
