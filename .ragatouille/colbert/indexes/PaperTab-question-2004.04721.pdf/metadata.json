      "Translation Artifacts in Cross-lingual Transfer Learning Mikel Artetxe, Gorka Labaka, Eneko Agirre HiTZ Center University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) {mikel.artetxe,gorka.labaka,e.agirre}@ehu.eus Abstract Both human and machine translation play a central role in cross-lingual transfer learning: many multilingual datasets have been created through professional translation services, and using machine translation to translate either the test set or the training set is a widely used transfer technique. In this paper, we show that such translation process can introduce subtle artifacts that have a notable impact in existing cross-lingual models. For instance, in natu- ral language inference, translating the premise and the hypothesis independently can reduce the lexical overlap between them, which cur- rent models are highly sensitive to. We show that some previous \ufb01ndings in cross-lingual transfer learning need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon. Based on the gained insights, we also improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI for the translate-test and zero-shot ap- proaches by 4.3 and 2.8 points, respectively.",
      "Based on the gained insights, we also improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI for the translate-test and zero-shot ap- proaches by 4.3 and 2.8 points, respectively. 1 Introduction While most NLP resources are English-speci\ufb01c, there have been several recent efforts to build multilingual benchmarks. One possibility is to collect and annotate data in multiple languages separately (Clark et al., 2020), but most exist- ing datasets have been created through translation (Conneau et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2020). This ap- proach has two desirable properties: it relies on ex- isting professional translation services rather than requiring expertise in multiple languages, and it results in parallel evaluation sets that offer a mean- ingful measure of the cross-lingual transfer gap of different models. The resulting multilingual datasets are generally used for evaluation only, re- lying on existing English datasets for training. Closely related to that, cross-lingual transfer learning aims to leverage large datasets avail- able in one language\u2014typically English\u2014to build multilingual models that can generalize to other languages.",
      "The resulting multilingual datasets are generally used for evaluation only, re- lying on existing English datasets for training. Closely related to that, cross-lingual transfer learning aims to leverage large datasets avail- able in one language\u2014typically English\u2014to build multilingual models that can generalize to other languages. Previous work has explored 3 main approaches to that end: machine translating the test set into English and using a monolingual En- glish model (TRANSLATE-TEST), machine translat- ing the training set into each target language and training the models on their respective languages (TRANSLATE-TRAIN), or using English data to \ufb01ne- tune a multilingual model that is then transferred to the rest of languages (ZERO-SHOT). The dataset creation and transfer procedures de- scribed above result in a mixture of original,1 human translated and machine translated data when dealing with cross-lingual models.",
      "The dataset creation and transfer procedures de- scribed above result in a mixture of original,1 human translated and machine translated data when dealing with cross-lingual models. In fact, the type of text a system is trained on does not typically match the type of text it is exposed to at test time: TRANSLATE-TEST systems are trained on original data and evaluated on machine translated test sets, ZERO-SHOT systems are trained on orig- inal data and evaluated on human translated test sets, and TRANSLATE-TRAIN systems are trained on machine translated data and evaluated on human translated test sets. Despite overlooked to date, we show that such mismatch has a notable impact in the perfor- mance of existing cross-lingual models. By using back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016) to para- phrase each training instance, we obtain another English version of the training set that better re- sembles the test set, obtaining substantial improve- ments for the TRANSLATE-TEST and ZERO-SHOT ap- proaches in cross-lingual Natural Language Infer- ence (NLI).",
      "While improvements brought by ma- chine translation have previously been attributed to data augmentation (Singh et al., 2019), we re- ject this hypothesis and show that the phenomenon is only present in translated test sets, but not in original ones. Instead, our analysis reveals that 1We use the term original to refer to non-translated text. arXiv:2004.04721v4  [cs.CL]  14 Dec 2020",
      "this behavior is caused by subtle artifacts arising from the translation process itself. In particular, we show that translating different parts of each instance separately (e.g., the premise and the hy- pothesis in NLI) can alter super\ufb01cial patterns in the data (e.g., the degree of lexical overlap between them), which severely affects the generalization ability of current models. Based on the gained in- sights, we improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI, and show that some previous \ufb01ndings need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon. 2 Related work Cross-lingual transfer learning. Current cross- lingual models work by pre-training multilingual representations using some form of language mod- eling, which are then \ufb01ne-tuned on the relevant task and transferred to different languages. Some authors leverage parallel data to that end (Conneau and Lample, 2019; Huang et al., 2019), but training a model akin to BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) on the combination of monolingual corpora in multiple languages is also effective (Conneau et al., 2020).",
      "Closely related to our work, Singh et al. (2019) showed that replacing segments of the training data with their translation during \ufb01ne-tuning is help- ful. However, they attribute this behavior to a data augmentation effect, which we believe should be reconsidered given the new evidence we provide. Multilingual benchmarks. Most benchmarks covering a wide set of languages have been cre- ated through translation, as it is the case of XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018) for NLI, PAWS-X (Yang et al., 2019) for adversarial paraphrase identi\ufb01ca- tion, and XQuAD (Artetxe et al., 2020) and MLQA (Lewis et al., 2020) for Question Answering (QA). A notable exception is TyDi QA (Clark et al., 2020), a contemporaneous QA dataset that was separately annotated in 11 languages.",
      "A notable exception is TyDi QA (Clark et al., 2020), a contemporaneous QA dataset that was separately annotated in 11 languages. Other cross-lingual datasets leverage existing multilingual resources, as it is the case of MLDoc (Schwenk and Li, 2018) for document classi\ufb01cation and Wikiann (Pan et al., 2017) for named entity recognition. Concurrent to our work, Hu et al. (2020) combine some of these datasets into a single multilingual benchmark, and evaluate some well-known methods on it. Annotation artifacts. Several studies have shown that NLI datasets like SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) contain spurious patterns that can be exploited to obtain strong results without making real inferential deci- sions. For instance, Gururangan et al. (2018) and Poliak et al. (2018) showed that a hypothesis-only baseline performs better than chance due to cues on their lexical choice and sentence length. Similarly, McCoy et al.",
      "For instance, Gururangan et al. (2018) and Poliak et al. (2018) showed that a hypothesis-only baseline performs better than chance due to cues on their lexical choice and sentence length. Similarly, McCoy et al. (2019) showed that NLI models tend to predict entailment for sentence pairs with a high lexical overlap. Several authors have worked on adversarial datasets to diagnose these issues and provide a more challenging benchmark (Naik et al., 2018; Glockner et al., 2018; Nie et al., 2020). Be- sides NLI, other tasks like QA have also been found to be susceptible to annotation artifacts (Jia and Liang, 2017; Kaushik and Lipton, 2018). While previous work has focused on the monolingual sce- nario, we show that translation can interfere with these artifacts in multilingual settings. Translationese. Translated texts are known to have unique features like simpli\ufb01cation, explicita- tion, normalization and interference, which are re- fer to as translationese (Volansky et al., 2013).",
      "Translationese. Translated texts are known to have unique features like simpli\ufb01cation, explicita- tion, normalization and interference, which are re- fer to as translationese (Volansky et al., 2013). This phenomenon has been reported to have a notable impact in machine translation evaluation (Zhang and Toral, 2019; Graham et al., 2019). For instance, back-translation brings large BLEU gains for re- versed test sets (i.e., when translationese is on the source side and original text is used as reference), but its effect diminishes in the natural direction (Edunov et al., 2020). While connected, the phe- nomenon we analyze is different in that it arises from translation inconsistencies due to the lack of context, and affects cross-lingual transfer learning rather than machine translation. 3 Experimental design Our goal is to analyze the effect of both human and machine translation in cross-lingual models.",
      "3 Experimental design Our goal is to analyze the effect of both human and machine translation in cross-lingual models. For that purpose, the core idea of our work is to (i) use machine translation to either translate the train- ing set into other languages, or generate English paraphrases of it through back-translation, and (ii) evaluate the resulting systems on original, human translated and machine translated test sets in com- parison with systems trained on original data. We next describe the models used in our experiments (\u00a73.1), the speci\ufb01c training variants explored (\u00a73.2), and the evaluation procedure followed (\u00a73.3). 3.1 Models and transfer methods We experiment with two models that are represen- tative of the state-of-the-art in monolingual and",
      "cross-lingual pre-training: (i) ROBERTA (Liu et al., 2019), which is an improved version of BERT that uses masked language modeling to pre-train an En- glish Transformer model, and (ii) XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), which is a multilingual extension of the former pre-trained on 100 languages. In both cases, we use the large models released by the au- thors under the fairseq repository.2 As discussed next, we explore different variants of the training set to \ufb01ne-tune each model on different tasks. At test time, we try both machine translating the test set into English (TRANSLATE-TEST) and, in the case of XLM-R, using the actual test set in the target language (ZERO-SHOT).",

For sentences occurring multiple times in the train- ing set (e.g., premises repeated for multiple hy- potheses), we use the exact same translation for all occurrences, as our goal is to understand the in- herent effect of translation rather than its potential application as a data augmentation method. In order to train the machine translation systems for MT-XX and BT-XX, we use the big Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) with the same settings as Ott et al.",

(2018) and SentencePiece tokeniza- tion (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) with a joint vo- cabulary of 32k subwords. For English-Spanish, we train for 10 epochs on all parallel data from WMT 2013 (Bojar et al., 2013) and ParaCrawl v5.0 (Espl`a et al., 2019). For English-Finnish, we train for 40 epochs on Europarl and Wiki Titles from WMT 2019 (Barrault et al., 2019), ParaCrawl v5.0, and DGT, EUbookshop and TildeMODEL from OPUS (Tiedemann, 2012).",
      "In both cases, we remove sentences longer than 250 tokens, with a source/target ratio exceeding 1.5, or for which langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012) predicts a different language, resulting in a \ufb01nal corpus size of 48M and 7M sentence pairs, respectively. We use sampling decoding with a temperature of 0.5 for inference, which produces more diverse transla- tions than beam search (Edunov et al., 2018) and performed better in our preliminary experiments. 2https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq 3.3 Tasks and evaluation procedure We use the following tasks for our experiments: Natural Language Inference (NLI). Given a premise and a hypothesis, the task is to determine whether there is an entailment, neutral or contra- diction relation between them. We \ufb01ne-tune our models on MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) for 10 epochs using the same settings as Liu et al. (2019).",
      "We \ufb01ne-tune our models on MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) for 10 epochs using the same settings as Liu et al. (2019). In most of our experiments, we evaluate on XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018), which comprises 2490 de- velopment and 5010 test instances in 15 languages. These were originally annotated in English, and the resulting premises and hypotheses were indepen- dently translated into the rest of the languages by professional translators. For the TRANSLATE-TEST approach, we use the machine translated versions from the authors. Following Conneau et al. (2020), we select the best epoch checkpoint according to the average accuracy in the development set. Question Answering (QA). Given a context paragraph and a question, the task is to identify the span answering the question in the context. We \ufb01ne-tune our models on SQuAD v1.1 (Ra- jpurkar et al., 2016) for 2 epochs using the same settings as Liu et al. (2019), and report test results for the last epoch.",

Finally, it is also interesting that MT-ES is only marginally better than MT-FI in both Spanish test sets, even if it corresponds to the TRANSLATE- TRAIN approach, whereas MT-FI needs to ZERO-SHOT transfer from Finnish into Spanish. This reinforces the idea that it is training on translated data rather than training on the target language that is key in TRANSLATE-TRAIN. 4.4 Stress tests In order to better understand how systems trained on original and translated data differ, we run addi- tional experiments on the NLI Stress Tests (Naik et al., 2018), which were designed to test the ro- bustness of NLI models to speci\ufb01c linguistic phe- nomena in English.",
      "The benchmark consists of a competence test, which evaluates the ability to un- derstand antonymy relation and perform numerical reasoning, a distraction test, which evaluates the robustness to shallow patterns like lexical overlap and the presence of negation words, and a noise test, which evaluates robustness to spelling errors. Just as with previous experiments, we report results for the best epoch checkpoint in each test set. As shown in Table 3, ORIG outperforms BT-FI and MT-FI on the competence test by a large mar- gin, but the opposite is true on the distraction test.8 In particular, our results show that BT-FI and MT-FI are less reliant on lexical overlap and the presence of negative words. This feels intuitive, as translat- ing the premise and hypothesis independently\u2014as BT-FI and MT-FI do\u2014is likely to reduce the lexical overlap between them. More generally, the trans- 8We observe similar trends for BT-ES and MT-ES, but omit these results for conciseness.",
      "lation process can alter similar super\ufb01cial patterns in the data, which NLI models are sensitive to (\u00a72). This would explain why the resulting models have a different behavior on different stress tests. 4.5 Output class distribution With the aim to understand the effect of the previ- ous phenomenon in cross-lingual settings, we look at the output class distribution of our different mod- els in the XNLI development set. As shown in Ta- ble 4, the predictions of all systems are close to the true class distribution in the case of English. Nev- ertheless, ORIG is strongly biased for the rest of lan- guages, and tends to underpredict entailment and overpredict neutral. This can again be attributed to the fact that the English test set is original, whereas the rest are human translated. In particular, it is well-known that NLI models tend to predict entail- ment when there is a high lexical overlap between the premise and the hypothesis (\u00a72). However, the degree of overlap will be smaller in the human translated test sets given that the premise and the hypothesis were translated independently, which explains why entailment is underpredicted.",
      "However, the degree of overlap will be smaller in the human translated test sets given that the premise and the hypothesis were translated independently, which explains why entailment is underpredicted. In con- trast, BT-FI and MT-FI are exposed to the exact same phenomenon during training, which explains why they are not that heavily affected. So as to measure the impact of this phenomenon, we explore a simple approach to correct this bias: having \ufb01ne-tuned each model, we adjust the bias term added to the logit of each class so the model predictions match the true class distribution for each language.9 As shown in Table 5, this brings large improvements for ORIG, but is less effective for BT-FI and MT-FI.10 This shows that the perfor- mance of ORIG was considerably hindered by this bias, which BT-FI and MT-FI effectively mitigate. 4.6 Comparison with the state-of-the-art So as to put our results into perspective, we com- pare our best variant to previous work on the XNLI test set.",

As shown in Table 6, our method improves the state-of-the-art for both the TRANSLATE-TEST and the ZERO-SHOT approaches by 4.3 and 2.8 points, 9We achieve this using an iterative procedure where, at each step, we select one class and set its bias term so the class is selected for the right percentage of examples. 10Note that we are adjusting the bias term in the evaluation set itself, which requires knowing its class distribution and is thus a form of cheating. While useful for analysis, a fair comparison would require adjusting the bias term in a separate validation set.

It also obtains the best overall results published to date, with the additional advantage that the previous state-of-the-art required a ma- chine translation system between English and each of the 14 target languages, whereas our method uses a single machine translation system between English and Finnish (which is not one of the target languages).

Our XQuAD results in Table 8 are more positive, but still inconclusive. These results can partly be explained by the translation procedure used to create the different benchmarks: the premises and hypotheses of XNLI were translated independently, whereas the ques- tions and context paragraphs of XQuAD were trans- lated together. Similarly, MLQA made use of par- allel contexts, and translators were shown the sen- tence containing each answer when translating the corresponding question.",
      "Similarly, MLQA made use of par- allel contexts, and translators were shown the sen- tence containing each answer when translating the corresponding question. As a result, one can ex- pect both QA benchmarks to have more consistent translations than XNLI, which would in turn di- minish this phenomenon. In contrast, the questions and context paragraphs are independently trans- lated when using machine translation, which ex- plains why BT-ES and BT-FI outperform ORIG for the TRANSLATE-TEST approach. We conclude that the translation artifacts revealed by our analysis are not exclusive to NLI, as they also show up on QA for the TRANSLATE-TEST approach, but their actual impact can be highly dependent on the translation procedure used and the nature of the task. 6 Discussion Our analysis prompts to reconsider previous \ufb01nd- ings in cross-lingual transfer learning as follows: The cross-lingual transfer gap on XNLI was overestimated. Given the parallel nature of XNLI, accuracy differences across languages are commonly interpreted as the loss of performance when generalizing from English to the rest of lan- guages.",
      "Given the parallel nature of XNLI, accuracy differences across languages are commonly interpreted as the loss of performance when generalizing from English to the rest of lan- guages. However, our work shows that there is another factor that can have a much larger impact: the loss of performance when generalizing from original to translated data. Our results suggest that the real cross-lingual generalization ability of XLM- R is considerably better than what the accuracy numbers in XNLI re\ufb02ect. Overcoming the cross-lingual gap is not what makes TRANSLATE-TRAIN work. The original motivation for TRANSLATE-TRAIN was to train the model on the same language it is tested on. How- ever, we show that it is training on translated data, rather than training on the target language, that is key for this approach to outperform ZERO-SHOT as reported by previous authors. Improvements previously attributed to data augmentation should be reconsidered. The method by Singh et al. (2019) combines machine translated premises and hypotheses in different languages (\u00a72), resulting in an effect similar to BT-XX and MT-XX.",

As such, we believe that this method should be analyzed from the point of view of dataset artifacts rather than data augmentation, as the authors do.11 From this perspective, having the premise and the hypotheses in different lan- guages can reduce the super\ufb01cial patterns between them, which would explain why this approach is better than using examples in a single language. 11Recall that our experimental design prevents a data aug- mentation effect, in that the number of unique sentences and examples used for training is always the same (\u00a73.2).",

Our work reduces this gap to only 0.8 points by addressing the underlying transla- tion artifacts. The reason why TRANSLATE-TEST is more severely affected by this phenomenon is twofold: (i) the effect is doubled by \ufb01rst using human translation to create the test set and then ma- chine translation to translate it back to English, and (ii) TRANSLATE-TRAIN was inadvertently mitigating this issue (see above), but equivalent techniques were never applied to TRANSLATE-TEST.",

Finally, we have shown that the phenomenon is not speci\ufb01c to NLI but also affects QA, although it is less pro- nounced there thanks to the translation procedure used in the corresponding benchmarks. So as to facilitate similar studies in the future, we release",
      "our NLI dataset,13 which, unlike previous bench- marks, was annotated in a non-English language and human translated into English.
