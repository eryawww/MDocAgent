  "arXiv:1701.09123v1  [cs.CL]  31 Jan 2017 Robust Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Shallow Semi-Supervised Features\u2217\u2020 Rodrigo Agerri\u2021and German Rigau IXA NLP Group University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) Donostia-San Sebasti\u00b4an, Spain Abstract We present a multilingual Named Entity Recognition approach based on a robust and general set of features across languages and datasets. Our system combines shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on large amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empirical experimentation how to e\ufb00ectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across \ufb01ve languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch. Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German.",
  "The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch. Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on manually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models. The system and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.

  "provide an adequate and comprehensive account of named entities in text it is necessary to recognize the mention of a named entity and to classify it by a pre-de\ufb01ned type (e.g, person, location, organization). Named Entity Recognition and Classi\ufb01cation (NERC) is usually a required step to perform Named Entity Disambiguation (NED), namely to link \u2018Europe\u2019 to the right Wikipedia article, and to resolve every form of mentioning or co-referring to the same entity. Nowadays NERC systems are widely being used in research for tasks such as Coreference Resolution (Pradhan et al., 2012), Named Entity Disambiguation (Cucerzan, 2007; Han and Sun, 2011; Ho\ufb00art et al., 2011; Mendes et al., 2011; Hachey et al., 2013) for which a lot of interest has been created by the TAC KBP shared tasks (Ji and Grishman, 2011), Machine Translation (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Koehn et al., 2007; Babych and Hartley, 2003;",
  "2011), Machine Translation (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Koehn et al., 2007; Babych and Hartley, 2003; Li et al., 2013), As- pect Based Sentiment Analysis (Liu, 2012; Cambria et al., 2013; Pontiki et al., 2014, 2015), Event Extraction (Doddington et al., 2004; Ahn, 2006; Ji and Grishman, 2008; Cybulska and Vossen, 2013; Hong et al., 2011) and Event Ordering (Minard et al., 2015).

Moreover, NERC systems are integrated in the processing chain of many industrial software applications, mostly by companies o\ufb00ering speci\ufb01c solutions for a particular industrial sector which require recognizing named entities speci\ufb01c of their domain. There is therefore a clear interest in both academic research and industry to develop robust and e\ufb03cient NERC systems: For industrial vendors it is particularly important to diversify their services by including NLP technology for a variety of languages whereas in academic research NERC is one of the foundations of many other NLP end-tasks. Most NERC taggers are supervised statistical systems that extract patterns and term features which are considered to be indications of Named Entity (NE) types using the manually annotated training data (extracting orthographic, linguistic and other types of evidence) and often exter- nal knowledge resources. As in other NLP tasks, supervised statistical NERC systems are more robust and obtain better performance on available evaluation sets, although sometimes the statis- tical models can also be combined with speci\ufb01c rules for some NE types.",
  "As in other NLP tasks, supervised statistical NERC systems are more robust and obtain better performance on available evaluation sets, although sometimes the statis- tical models can also be combined with speci\ufb01c rules for some NE types. For best performance, supervised statistical approaches require manually annotated training data, which is both expen- sive and time-consuming. This has seriously hindered the development of robust high performing NERC systems for many languages but also for other domains and text genres (Nobata et al., 2000; Ritter et al., 2011), in what we will henceforth call \u2018out-of-domain\u2019 evaluations. Moreover, supervised NERC systems often require \ufb01ne-tuning for each language and, as some of the features require language-speci\ufb01c knowledge, this poses yet an extra complication for the development of robust multilingual NERC systems. For example, it is well-known that in Ger- man every noun is capitalized and that compounds including named entities are pervasive. This also applies to agglutinative languages such as Basque, Korean, Finnish, Japanese, Hungarian or Turkish.",
  "For example, it is well-known that in Ger- man every noun is capitalized and that compounds including named entities are pervasive. This also applies to agglutinative languages such as Basque, Korean, Finnish, Japanese, Hungarian or Turkish. For this type of languages, it had usually been assumed that linguistic features (typically Part of Speech (POS) and lemmas, but also semantic features based on WordNet, for example) and perhaps speci\ufb01c hand-crafted rules, were a necessary condition for good NERC performance as they would allow to capture better the most recurrent declensions (cases) of named entities for Basque (Alegria et al., 2006) or to address problems such as sparsity and capitalization of every noun for German (Faruqui et al., 2010; Benikova et al., 2014, 2015). This language dependency was easy to see in the CoNLL 2002 and 2003 tasks, in which systems participating in the two available languages for each edition obtained in general di\ufb00erent results for each language.",
  "This language dependency was easy to see in the CoNLL 2002 and 2003 tasks, in which systems participating in the two available languages for each edition obtained in general di\ufb00erent results for each language. This suggests that without \ufb01ne-tuning for each corpus and language, the systems did not generalize well across languages (Nothman et al., 2013). This paper presents a multilingual and robust NERC system based on simple, general and shal- low features that heavily relies on word representation features for high performance. Even though we do not use linguistic motivated features, our approach also works well for in\ufb02ected languages 2",
  "such as Basque and German. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach by reporting best results for \ufb01ve languages (Basque, Dutch, German, English and Spanish) on 12 di\ufb00erent datasets, including seven in-domain and eight out-of-domain evaluations. 1.1 Contributions The main contributions of this paper are the following: First, we show how to easily develop robust NERC systems across datasets and languages with minimal human intervention, even for languages with declension and/or complex morphology. Second, we empirically show how to e\ufb00ectively use various types of simple word representation features thereby providing a clear methodology for choosing and combining them. Third, we demonstrate that our system still obtains very competitive results even when the supervised data is reduced by half (even less in some cases), alleviating the dependency on costly hand annotated data. These three main contributions are based on: 1. A simple and shallow robust set of features across languages and datasets, even in out-of- domain evaluations. 2. The lack of linguistic motivated features, even for languages with agglutinative (e.g., Basque) and/or complex morphology (e.g., German). 3.",

The lack of linguistic motivated features, even for languages with agglutinative (e.g., Basque) and/or complex morphology (e.g., German). 3. A clear methodology for using and combining various types of word representation features by leveraging public unlabeled data. Our approach consists of shallow local features complemented by three types of word repre- sentation (clustering) features: Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992), Clark clusters (Clark, 2003) and K-means clusters on top of the word vectors obtained by using the Skip-gram algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013). We demonstrate that combining and stacking di\ufb00erent clustering features induced from various data sources (Reuters, Wikipedia, Gigaword, etc.) allows to cover di\ufb00er- ent and more varied types of named entities without manual feature tuning. Even though our approach is much simpler than most, we obtain the best results for Dutch, Spanish and English and comparable results in German (on CoNLL 2002 and 2003).",

Even though our approach is much simpler than most, we obtain the best results for Dutch, Spanish and English and comparable results in German (on CoNLL 2002 and 2003). We also report best results for German using the GermEval 2014 shared task data and for Basque using the Egunkaria testset (Alegria et al., 2006). We report out-of-domain evaluations in three languages (Dutch, English and Spanish) using four di\ufb00erent datasets to compare our system with the best publicly available systems for those languages: Illinois NER (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) for English, Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005) for English and Spanish, SONAR-1 NERD for Dutch (Desmet and Hoste, 2014) and Freeling for Spanish (Padr\u00b4o and Stanilovsky, 2012). We outperform every other system in the eight out-of- domain evaluations reported in Section 4.3.",
  "We outperform every other system in the eight out-of- domain evaluations reported in Section 4.3. Furthermore, the out-of-domain results show that our clustering features provide a simple and easy method to improve the robustness of NERC systems. Finally, and inspired by previous work (Koo et al., 2008; Biemann, 2009) we measure how much supervision is required to obtain state of the art results. In Section 4.2 we show that we can still obtain very competitive results reducing the supervised data by half (and sometimes even more). This, together with the lack of linguistic features, means that our system considerably saves data annotation costs, which is quite convenient when trying to develop a NERC system for a new language and/or domain. Our system learns Perceptron models (Collins, 2002) using the Machine Learning machinery provided by the Apache OpenNLP project2 with our own customized (local and clustering) features. 2http://opennlp.apache.org/ 3",
  "Our NERC system is publicly available and distributed under the Apache 2.0 License and part of the IXA pipes tools (Agerri et al., 2014). Every result reported in this paper is obtained using the conlleval script from the CoNLL 2002 and CoNLL 2003 shared tasks3. To guarantee reproducibility of results we also make publicly available the models and the scripts used to perform the evaluations. The system, models and evaluation scripts can be found in the ixa-pipe-nerc website4. Next Section reviews related work, focusing on best performing NERC systems for each lan- guage evaluated on standard shared evaluation task data. Section 3 presents the design of our system and our overall approach to NERC. In Section 4 we report the evaluation results obtained by our system for 5 languages (Basque, Dutch, German, English and Spanish) on 12 di\ufb00erent datasets, distributed in 7 in-domain and 8 out-of-domain evaluations. Section 5 discusses the re- sults and contributions of our approach.",
  "Section 5 discusses the re- sults and contributions of our approach. In Section 6 we highlight the main aspects of our work providing some concluding remarks and future work to be done using our NERC approach applied to other text genres, domains and sequence labeling tasks. 2 Related Work The Named Entity Recognition and Classi\ufb01cation (NERC) task was \ufb01rst de\ufb01ned for the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC 6) (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). The MUC 6 tasks fo- cused on Information Extraction (IE) from unstructured text and NERC was deemed to be an important IE sub-task with the aim of recognizing and classifying nominal mentions of persons, organizations and locations, and also numeric expressions of dates, money, percentage and time. In the following years, research on NERC increased as it was considered to be a crucial source of information for other Natural Language Processing tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Textual Entailment (RTE) (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).",
  "In the following years, research on NERC increased as it was considered to be a crucial source of information for other Natural Language Processing tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Textual Entailment (RTE) (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). Furthermore, while MUC 6 was solely devoted to English as target language, the CoNLL shared tasks (2002 and 2003) boosted research on language independent NERC for 3 additional target languages: Dutch, German and Spanish (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). The various MUC, ACE and CoNLL evaluations provided a very convenient framework to test and compare NERC systems, algorithms and approaches. They provided manually annotated data for training and testing the systems as well as an objective evaluation methodology. Using such framework, research rapidly evolved from rule-based approaches (consisting of manually hand- crafted rules) to language independent systems focused on learning supervised statistical models.",

Thus, while in the MUC 6 competition 5 out of 8 systems were rule-based, in CoNLL 2003 16 teams participated in the English task all using statistical-based NERC (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). 2.1 Datasets Table 1 describes the 12 datasets used in this paper. The \ufb01rst half lists the corpora used for in- domain evaluation whereas the lower half contains the out-of-domain datasets. The CoNLL NER shared tasks focused on language independent machine learning approaches for 4 entity types: person, location, organization and miscellaneous entities. The 2002 edition provided manually annotated data in Dutch and Spanish whereas in 2003 the languages were German and English. In addition to the CoNLL data, for English we also use the formal run of MUC 7 and Wikigold for out-of-domain evaluation.",

As there are not standard partitions of SONAR-1 and Ancora 2.0, the full corpus was used for training and later evaluated in-out-of-domain settings. The Wikigold corpus consists of 39K words of English Wikipedia manually annotated following the CoNLL 2003 guidelines (Nothman et al., 2013). For Spanish and Dutch, we also use Ancora 2.0 (Taul\u00b4e et al., 2008) and SONAR-1 (Desmet and Hoste, 2014) respectively. SONAR-1 is a one million word Dutch corpus with both coarse-grained and \ufb01ne-grained named entity annotations. The coarse-grained level includes product and event entity types in addition to the four types de\ufb01ned in CoNLL data. Ancora adds date and number types to the CoNLL four main types. In Basque the only gold standard corpus is Egunkaria (Alegria et al., 2006).",
  "Ancora adds date and number types to the CoNLL four main types. In Basque the only gold standard corpus is Egunkaria (Alegria et al., 2006). Although the Basque Egunkaria dataset is annotated with four entity types, the miscellaneous class is extremely sparse, occurring only in a proportion of 1 to 10. Thus, in the training data there are 156 entities annotated as MISC whereas each of the other three classes contain around 1200 entities. In the datasets described so far, named entities were assumed to be non-recursive and non- overlapping. During the annotation process, if a named entity was embedded in a longer one, then only the longest mention was annotated. The exceptions are the GermEval 2014 shared task data for German and MEANTIME, where nested entities are also annotated (both inner and outer spans). The GermEval 2014 NER shared task (Benikova et al., 2014) aimed at improving the state of the art of German NERC which was perceived to be comparatively lower than the English NERC.",
  "The GermEval 2014 NER shared task (Benikova et al., 2014) aimed at improving the state of the art of German NERC which was perceived to be comparatively lower than the English NERC. Two main extensions were introduced in GermEval 2014; (i) \ufb01ne grained named entity sub-types to indicate derivations and compounds; (ii) embedded entities (and not only the longest span) are annotated. In total, there are 12 types for classi\ufb01cation: person, location, organization, other plus their sub-types annotated at their inner and outer levels. Finally, the MEANTIME corpus (Minard et al., 2016) is a multilingual (Dutch, English, Ital- ian and Spanish) publicly available evaluation set annotated within the Newsreader project5. It consists of 120 documents, divided into 4 topics: Apple Inc., Airbus and Boeing, General Motors, 5http://www.newsreader-project.eu 5",
  "Chrysler and Ford, and the stock market. The articles are selected in such a way that the corpus contains di\ufb00erent articles that deal with the same topic over time (e.g. launch of a new product, discussion of the same \ufb01nancial indexes). Moreover, it contains nested entities so the evaluation re- sults will be provided in terms of the outer and the inner spans of the named entities. MEANTIME includes six named entity types: person, location, organization, product, \ufb01nancial and mixed. 2.2 Related Approaches Named entity recognition is a task with a long history in NLP. Therefore, we will summarize those approaches that are most relevant to our work, especially those we will directly compared with in Section 4. Since CoNLL shared tasks, the most competitive approaches have been supervised systems learning CRF, SVM, Maximum Entropy or Averaged Perceptron models. In any case, while the machine learning method is important, it has also been demonstrated that good perfor- mance might largely be due to the feature set used (Clark and Curran, 2003).",

Linguistic Information Some of the CoNLL participants use linguistic information (POS, lem- mas, chunks, but also speci\ufb01c rules or patterns) for Dutch and English (Carreras et al., 2002; Clark and Curran, 2003), although these type of features was deemed to be most important for German, for which the use of linguistic features is pervasive (Benikova et al., 2014). This is caused by the sparsity caused by the declension cases, the tendency to form compounds containing named entities and by the capitalization of every noun (Faruqui et al., 2010).",
  "This is caused by the sparsity caused by the declension cases, the tendency to form compounds containing named entities and by the capitalization of every noun (Faruqui et al., 2010). For example, the best sys- tem among the 11 participants in GermEval 2014, ExB, uses morphological features and speci\ufb01c su\ufb03x lists aimed at capturing frequent patterns in the endings of named entities (H\u00a8anig et al., 2014). In agglutinative languages such as Basque, which contains declension cases for named entities, linguistic features are considered to be a requirement. For example, the country name \u2018Espainia\u2019 6",
  "(Spain in Basque) can occur in several forms, Espainian, Espainiera, Espainiak, Espainiarentzat, Espainiako, and many more.6 Linguistic information has been used to treat this phenomenon. The only previous work for Basque developed Eihera, a rule-based NERC system formalized as \ufb01nite state transducers to take into account declension classes (Alegria et al., 2006). The features of Eihera include word, lemma, POS, declension case, capitalized lemma, etc. These features are complemented with gazetteers extracted from the Euskaldunon Egunkaria newspaper and semantic information from the Basque WordNet. Gazetteers Dictionaries are widely used to inject world knowledge via gazetteer matches as features in machine learning approaches to NERC. The best performing systems carefully compile their own gazetteers from a variety of sources (Carreras et al., 2002). Ratinov and Roth (2009) leverage a collection of 30 gazetteers and matches against each one are weighted as a separate feature.",

Ratinov and Roth (2009) leverage a collection of 30 gazetteers and matches against each one are weighted as a separate feature. In this way they trust each gazetteer to a di\ufb00erent degree. Passos et al. (2014) carefully compiled a large collection of English gazetteers extracted from US Census data and Wikipedia and applied them to the process of inducing word embeddings with very good results. While it is possible to automatically extract them from various corpora or resources, they still require careful manual inspection of the target data. Thus, our approach only uses o\ufb00the shelf gazetteers whenever they are publicly available. Furthermore, our method collapses every gazetteer into one dictionary. This means that we only add a feature per token, instead of a feature per token and gazetteer. Global Features The intuition behind non-local (or global) features is to treat similarly all occurrences of the same named entity in a text. Carreras et al.",
  "This means that we only add a feature per token, instead of a feature per token and gazetteer. Global Features The intuition behind non-local (or global) features is to treat similarly all occurrences of the same named entity in a text. Carreras et al. (2002) proposed a method to produce the set of named entities for the whole sentence, where the optimal set of named entities for the sentence is the coherent set of named entities which maximizes the summation of con\ufb01dences of the named entities in the set. Ratinov and Roth (2009) developed three types of non-local features, analyzing global dependencies in a window of between 200 and 1000 tokens. Word representations Semi-supervised approaches leveraging unlabeled text had already been applied to improve results in various NLP tasks. More speci\ufb01cally, it had been previously shown how to apply Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) for Chinese Word Segmentation (Liang, 2005), de- pendency parsing (Koo et al., 2008), NERC (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) and POS tagging (Biemann, 2009).",
  "Ratinov and Roth (2009) used Brown clusters as features obtaining what was at the time the best published result of an English NERC system on the CoNLL 2003 testset. Turian et al. (2010) made a rather exhaustive comparison of Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston\u2019s embed- dings (Collobert and Weston, 2008) and HLBL embeddings (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) to improve chunking and NERC. They show that in some cases the combination of word representation fea- tures was positive but, although they used Ratinov and Roth\u2019s (2009) system as starting point, they did not manage to improve over the state of the art. Furthermore, they reported that Brown clustering features performed better than the word embeddings. Passos et al. (2014) extend the Skip-gram algorithm to learn 50-dimensional lexicon infused phrase embeddings from 22 di\ufb00erent gazetteers and the Wikipedia. The resulting embeddings are used as features by scaling them by a hyper-parameter which is a real number tuned on the development data. Passos et al.",

  "The best German CoNLL 2003 system (an ensemble) was outperformed by Faruqui et al. (2010). They trained the Stanford NER system (Finkel et al., 2005), which uses a linear-chain Conditional Random Field (CRF) with a variety of features, including lemma, POS tag, etc. Cru- cially, they included \u201cdistributional similarity\u201d features in the form of Clark clusters (Clark, 2003) induced from large unlabeled corpora: the Huge German Corpus (HGC) of around 175M tokens of newspaper text and the deWac corpus (Baroni et al., 2009) consisting of 1.71B tokens of web- crawled data. Using the clusters induced from deWac as a form of semi-supervision improved the results over the best CoNLL 2003 system by 4 points in F1.

  "Ensemble Systems The best participant of the English CoNLL 2003 shared task used the results of two externally trained NERC taggers to create an ensemble system (Florian et al., 2003). Passos et al. (2014) develop a stacked linear-chain CRF system: they train two CRFs with roughly the same features; the second CRF can condition on the predictions made by the \ufb01rst CRF. Their \u201cbaseline\u201d system uses a similar local featureset as Ratinov and Roth\u2019s (2009) but complemented with gazetteers. Their baseline system combined with their phrase embeddings trained with infused lexicons allow them to report the best CoNLL 2003 result so far. The best system of the GermEval 2014 task built an ensemble of classi\ufb01ers and pattern ex- tractors to \ufb01nd the most likely tag sequence (H\u00a8anig et al., 2014).

  "They paid special attention to out of vocabulary words which are addressed by semi-supervised word representation features and an ensemble of POS taggers. Furthermore, remaining unknown candidate mentions are tackled by look-up via the Wikipedia API. Apart from the feature types, the last two columns of Table 2 refer to whether the systems are publicly available and whether any external resources used for training are made available (e.g., induced word embeddings, gazetteers or corpora). This is desirable to be able to re-train the systems on di\ufb00erent datasets. For example, we would have been interested in training the Stanford NER system with the full Ancora corpus for the evaluation presented in Table 16, but their Spanish cluster lexicon is not available. Alternatively, we would have liked to train our system with the same Ancora partition used to train Stanford NER, but that is not available either. 3 System Description The design of ixa-pipe-nerc aims at establishing a simple and shallow feature set, avoiding any linguistic motivated features, with the objective of removing any reliance on costly extra gold an- notations (POS tags, lemmas, syntax, semantics) and/or cascading errors if automatic language processors are used.",

  "English: Morras was junior world champion in 1994, in the capital of Ecuador, Quito. Current token is \u2018Ekuadorko\u2019. 3.1 Local Features The local features constitute our baseline system on top of which the clustering features are added. We implement the following feature set, partially inspired by previous work (Zhang and Johnson, 2003): \u2022 Token: Current lowercase token (w), namely, ekuadorko in Table 3. \u2022 Token Shape: Current lowercase token (w) plus current token shape (wc), where token shape consist of: (i) The token is either lowercase or a 2 digit word or a 4 digit word; (ii) If the token contains digits, then whether it also contains letters, or slashes, or hyphens, or commas, or periods or is numeric; (iii) The token is all uppercase letters or is an acronym or is a one letter uppercase word or starts with capital letter. Thus, in Table 3 1994an is a 4 digit word (4d), Ekuadorko has an initial capital shape (ic) and hiriburuan is lowercase (lc).",
  "Thus, in Table 3 1994an is a 4 digit word (4d), Ekuadorko has an initial capital shape (ic) and hiriburuan is lowercase (lc). \u2022 Previous prediction: the previous outcome (pd) for the current token. The previous predic- tions in our example are null because these words have not been seen previously, except for the comma. \u2022 Sentence: Whether the token is the beginning of the sentence. None of the tokens in our example is at the beginning of the sentence, so this feature is not active in Table 3. \u2022 Pre\ufb01x: Two pre\ufb01xes consisting of the \ufb01rst three and four characters of the current token: Eku and Ekua. \u2022 Su\ufb03x: The four su\ufb03xes of length one to four from the last four characters of the current token. \u2022 Bigram: Bigrams including the current token and the token shape. \u2022 Trigram: Trigrams including the current token and the token shape. 9",
  "\u2022 Character n-gram: All lowercase character bigrams, trigrams, fourgrams and \ufb01vegrams from the current token (ng). Token, token shape and previous prediction features are placed in a 5 token window, namely, for these these three features we also consider the previous and the next two words, as shown in Table 3. 3.2 Gazetteers We add gazetteers to our system only if they are readily available to use, but our approach does not fundamentally depend upon them. We perform a look-up in a gazetteer to check if a named entity occurs in the sentence. The result of the look-up is represented with the same encoding chosen for the training process, namely, the BIO or BILOU scheme8. Thus, for the current token we add the following features: 1. The current named entity class in the encoding schema. Thus, in the BILOU encoding we would have \u201cunit\u201d, \u201cbeginning\u201d, \u201clast\u201d, \u201cinside\u201d, or if not match is found, \u201coutside\u201d, combined with the speci\ufb01c named entity type (LOC, ORG, PER, MISC, etc.). 2.",

The current named entity class as above and the current token. 3.3 Clustering Features The general idea is that by using some type of semantic similarity or word cluster induced over large unlabeled corpora it is possible to improve the predictions for unseen words in the test set. This type of semi-supervised learning may be aimed at improving performance over a \ufb01xed amount of training data or, given a \ufb01xed target performance level, to establish how much supervised data is actually required to reach such performance (Koo et al., 2008). So far the most successful approaches have only used one type of word representation (Passos et al., 2014; Faruqui et al., 2010; Ratinov and Roth, 2009). However, our simple baseline combined with one type of word representation features are not able to compete with previous, more complex, systems.",
  "However, our simple baseline combined with one type of word representation features are not able to compete with previous, more complex, systems. Thus, instead of encoding more elaborate features, we have devised a simple method to combine and stack various types of clustering features induced over di\ufb00erent data sources or corpora. In principle, our method can be used with any type of word representations. However, for comparison purposes, we decided to use word representations previously used in successful NERC approaches: Brown clusters (Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Turian et al., 2010), Word2vec clus- ters (Passos et al., 2014) and Clark clusters (Finkel et al., 2005; Faruqui et al., 2010). As can be observed in Table 3, our clustering features are placed in a 5 token window. 3.3.1 Brown Features The Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992) is a hierarchical algorithm which clusters words to maximize the mutual information of bigrams.",
  "As can be observed in Table 3, our clustering features are placed in a 5 token window. 3.3.1 Brown Features The Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992) is a hierarchical algorithm which clusters words to maximize the mutual information of bigrams. Thus, it is a class-based bigram model in which: \u2022 The probability of a document corresponds to the product of the probabilities of its bigrams, 8The BIO scheme suggests to learn models that identify the Beginning, the Inside and the Outside of sequences. The BILOU scheme proposes to learn models Beginning, the Inside and the Last tokens of multi-token chunks as well as Unit-length chunks. 10",
  "\u2022 the probability of each bigram is calculated by multiplying the probability of a bigram model over latent classes by the probability of each class generating the actual word types in the bigram, and \u2022 each word type has non-zero probability only on a single class. The Brown algorithm takes a vocabulary of words to be clustered and a corpus of text containing these words. It starts by assigning each word in the vocabulary to its own separate cluster, then iteratively merges the pair of clusters which leads to the smallest decrease in the likelihood of the text corpus. This produces a hierarchical clustering of the words, which is usually represented as a binary tree, as shown in Figure 1. In this tree every word is uniquely identi\ufb01ed by its path from the root, and the path can be represented by a bit string. It is also possible to choose di\ufb00erent levels of word abstraction by choosing di\ufb00erent depths along the path from the root to the word. Therefore, by using paths of various lengths, we obtain clustering features of di\ufb00erent granularities (Miller et al., 2004).",
  "Therefore, by using paths of various lengths, we obtain clustering features of di\ufb00erent granularities (Miller et al., 2004). 1 11 111 in 110 of 10 101 run 100 bought 0 01 011 IBM 010 Apple 00 001 pear 000 apple Figure 1: A Brown clustering hierarchy. We use paths of length 4, 6, 10 and 20 as features (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). However, we introduce several novelties in the design of our Brown clustering features: 1. For each feature which is token-based, we add a feature containing the paths computed for the current token. Thus, taking into account our baseline system, we will add the following Brown clustering features: (a) Brown Token: existing paths of length 4, 6, 10 and 20 for the current token. (b) Brown Token Shape: existing paths of length 4, 6, 10, 20 for the current token and current token shape.",
  "(b) Brown Token Shape: existing paths of length 4, 6, 10, 20 for the current token and current token shape. (c) Brown Bigram: existing paths of length 4, 6, 10, 20 for bigrams including the current token. 2. Brown clustering features bene\ufb01t from two additional features: (a) Previous prediction plus token: the previous prediction (pd) for the current token and the current token. (b) Previous two predictions: the previous prediction for the current and the previous token. 11",
  "For space reasons, Table 3 only shows the Brown Token (bt) and Brown Token Shape (c) features for paths of length 4 and 6. We use the publicly available tool9 implemented by Liang (2005) with default settings. The input consists of a corpus tokenized and segmented one sentence per line, without punctuation. Furthermore, we follow previous work and remove all sentences which consist of less than 90% lowercase characters (Liang, 2005; Turian et al., 2010) before inducing the Brown clusters. 3.3.2 Clark Features Clark (2003) presents a number of unsupervised algorithms, based on distributional and morpho- logical information, for clustering words into classes from unlabeled text. The focus is on clustering infrequent words on a small numbers of clusters from comparatively small amounts of data. In particular, Clark (2003) presents an algorithm combining distributional information with morpho- logical information of words \u201cby composing the Ney-Essen clustering model with a model for the morphology within a Bayesian framework\u201d. The objective is to bias the distributional information to put words that are morphologically similar in the same cluster.",
  "The objective is to bias the distributional information to put words that are morphologically similar in the same cluster. We use the code released by Clark (2003) o\ufb00the shelf10 to induce Clark clusters using the Ney-Essen with morphological infor- mation method. The input of the algorithm is a sequence of lowercase tokens without punctuation, one token per line with sentence breaks. Our Clark clustering features are very simple: we perform a look-up of the current token in the clustering lexicon. If a match is found, we add as a feature the clustering class, or the lack of match if the token is not found (see Clark-a and Clark-b in Table 3). 3.3.3 Word2vec Features Another family of language models that produces word representations are the neural language models. These approaches produce representation of words as continuous vectors (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2007), also called word embeddings. Nowadays, perhaps the most popular among them is the Skip-gram algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
  "These approaches produce representation of words as continuous vectors (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2007), also called word embeddings. Nowadays, perhaps the most popular among them is the Skip-gram algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013). The Skip-gram algorithm uses shallow log-linear models to compute vector representation of words which are more e\ufb03cient than previous word representations induced on neural language models. Their objective is to produce word embeddings by computing the probability of each n-gram as the product of the conditional probabilities of each context word in the n-gram conditioned on its central word (Mikolov et al., 2013). Instead of using continuous vectors as real numbers, we induce clusters or word classes from the word vectors by applying K-means clustering. In this way we can use the cluster classes as simple binary features by injecting unigram match features. We use the Word2vec tool11 released by Mikolov et al. (2013) with a 5 window context to train 50-dimensional word embeddings and to obtain the word clusters on top of them.",
  "We use the Word2vec tool11 released by Mikolov et al. (2013) with a 5 window context to train 50-dimensional word embeddings and to obtain the word clusters on top of them. The input of the algorithm is a corpus tokenized, lowercased, with punctuation removed and in one line. The Word2vec features are implemented exactly like the Clark features. 3.3.4 Stacking and Combining Clustering Features We successfully combine clustering features from di\ufb00erent word representations. Furthermore, we also stack or accumulate features of the same type of word representation induced from di\ufb00erent 9https://github.com/percyliang/brown-cluster 10https://github.com/ninjin/clark_pos_induction 11https://code.google.com/p/Word2vec/ 12",
  "data sources, trusting each clustering lexicon to a di\ufb00erent degree, as shown by the \ufb01ve encoded clustering features in Table 3: two Clark and Word2vec features from di\ufb00erent source data and one Brown feature. When using word representations as semi-supervised features for a task like NERC, two principal factors need to be taken into account: (i) the source data or corpus used to induce the word representations and (ii) the actual word representation used to encode our features which in turn modify the weight of our model\u2019s parameters in the training process. For the clustering features to be e\ufb00ective the induced clusters need to contain as many words appearing in the training, development and test sets as possible. This can be achieved by using corpora closely related to the text genre or domain of the data sets or by using very large unlabeled corpora which, although not closely domain-related, be large enough to include many relevant words. For example, with respect to the CoNLL 2003 English dataset an example of the former would be the Reuters corpus while the Wikipedia would be an example of the latter.",
  "For example, with respect to the CoNLL 2003 English dataset an example of the former would be the Reuters corpus while the Wikipedia would be an example of the latter. The word representations obtained by di\ufb00erent algorithms would capture di\ufb00erent distributional properties of words in a given corpus or data source. Therefore, each type of clustering would allow us to capture di\ufb00erent types of occurring named entity types. In other words, combining and stacking di\ufb00erent types of clustering features induced over a variety of data sources should help to capture more similarities between di\ufb00erent words in the training and test sets, increasing the contribution to the weights of the model parameters in the training process. 4 Experimental Results In this Section we report on the experiments performed with the ixa-pipe-nerc system as described in the previous section.

Additionally, the English models use six gazetteers about the Global Automotive Industry provided by LexisNexis to the Newsreader project12, whereas the German models include, in addition to the Illinois gazetteers, the German dictionaries distributed in the CoNLL 2003 shared task. The gazetteers are collapsed into one large dictionary and deployed as described in Section 3.2. Finally, the clustering features are obtained by processing the following clusters from publicly available corpora: (i) 1000 Brown clusters; (ii) Clark and Word2vec clusters in the 100-600 range. To choose the best combination of clustering features we test the available permutations of Clark and Word2vec clusters with and without the Brown clusters on the development data.

  "In two cases, Dutch and German, we use two di\ufb00erent datasets, making it a total of seven in-domain evaluations. 4.1.1 English We tested our system in the highly competitive CoNLL 2003 dataset. Table 5 shows that three of our models outperform previous best results reported for English in the CoNLL 2003 dataset (Passos et al., 2014). Note that the best F1 score (91.36) is obtained by adding trigrams and character n-gram features to the best model (91.18). The results also show that these models improve the baseline provided by the local features by around 7 points in F1 score. The most signi\ufb01cant gain is in terms of recall, almost 9 points better than the baseline. We also report very competitive results, only marginally lower than Passos et al.

  "We also report very competitive results, only marginally lower than Passos et al. (2014), based on the stacking and combination of clustering features as described in Section 3.3.4.

(2010), and obtain only marginally lower results than Passos et al. (2014). The stacking and combining e\ufb00ect manifests itself very clearly when we compare the single clustering feature models (BR, CW600, W2VG200 and W2VW400) with the light, comp and best cluster models which improve the overall F1 score by 1.30, 1.72 and 1.85 respectively over the best single clustering model (CW600).

  "It is worth mentioning that our models do not score best in the development data. As the development data is closer in style and genre to the training data (Ratinov and Roth, 2009), this may suggest that our system generalizes better on test data that is not close to the training data; indeed, the results reported in Section 4.3 seem to con\ufb01rm this hypothesis. 12http://www.newsreader-project.eu 13http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2002/ner/bin/conlleval.txt 14",

  "While we have already commented the substantial gains obtained simply by adding our cluster- ing features, it is also interesting to note that the gains are much substantial when less supervised training data is available. Furthermore, it is striking that training our clustering features using only one eight of the training data (30K words) allows to obtain similar performance to the base- line system trained on the full training set. Equally interesting is the fact that cutting by half the training data only marginally harms the overall performance. Finally, training on just a quarter of the training set (60K) results in a very competitive model when compared with other publicly available NER systems for English trained on the full training set: it roughly matches Stanford NER\u2019s performance, it outperforms models using external knowledge or non-local features reported by Ratinov and Roth (2009), and also several models reported by Turian et al. (2010), which use one type of word representations on top of the baseline system.

First, we can observe that for every portion of the training set, both our best cluster and en-91-18 model outperform the Illinois NER system. The best cluster results are noteworthy because, as opposed to Illinois NER, it does not use gazetteers or global features for extra performance. These results are mirrored by those obtained for the rest of the languages and datasets. Thus, Table 14 displays, for each language, the F1 results of the baseline system and of the best cluster 18",

  "These di\ufb00erences can be of text genre and/or domain, but also because the assumptions of what constitutes a named entity might di\ufb00er. It is therefore interesting to develop robust NERC systems across both domains and datasets. In this section we demonstrate that our approach, consisting of basic, general local features and the combination and stacking of clusters, produces robust NERC systems in three out-of-domain evaluation settings: \u2022 Class disagreements: Named entities are assigned to di\ufb00erent classes in training and test. \u2022 Di\ufb00erent text genre: The text genre of training and test data di\ufb00ers. \u2022 Annotation guidelines: The gold annotation of the test data follows di\ufb00erent guidelines from the training data. This is usually re\ufb02ected in di\ufb00erent named entity spans. The datasets and languages chosen for these experiments are based on the availability of both previous results and publicly distributed NERC systems to facilitate direct comparison of our system with other approaches.

  "4.3.1 Class Disagreements MUC 7 annotates seven entity types, including four that are not included in CoNLL data: DATE, MONEY, NUMBER and TIME entities. Furthermore, CoNLL includes the MISC class, which was absent in MUC 7. This means that there are class disagreements in the gold standard annotation between the training and test datasets. In addition to the four CoNLL classes, SONAR-1 includes PRODUCT and EVENT whereas Ancora also annotates DATE and NUMBER. For example, consider the following sentence of the MUC 7 gold standard (example taken from Ratinov and Roth (2009)): \u201c...baloon, called the Virgin Global Challenger.\u201d The gold annotation in MUC 7 establishes that there is one named entity: \u201c...baloon, called [ORG Virgin] Global Challenger.\u201d However, according to CoNLL 2003 guidelines, the entire name should be annotated like MISC: \u201c...baloon, called [MISC Virgin Global Challenger].\u201d In this setting some adjustments are made to the NERC systems\u2019 output.",

  "4.3.3 Annotation Guidelines In this section the objective is studying not so much the di\ufb00erences in textual genre as the in\ufb02uence of substantially di\ufb00erent annotation standards. We only use three classes (location, organization and person) to evaluate the best models presented for in-domain evaluations labeling \u2018O\u2019 every entity which is not LOC, ORG or PER. The text genre of MEANTIME is not that di\ufb00erent from CoNLL data. However, di\ufb00erences in the gold standard annotation result in signi\ufb01cant disagreements regarding the span of the named entities (Tonelli et al., 2014). For example, the following issues are markedly di\ufb00erent with respect to the training data we use for each language: \u2022 Di\ufb00erent criteria to decide when a named entity is annotated: in the expression \u201c40 billion US air tanker contract\u201d the MEANTIME gold standard does not mark \u2018US\u2019 as location, whereas in the training data this is systematically annotated. \u2022 Mentions including the de\ufb01nite article within the name entity span: \u2018the United States\u2019 versus \u2018United States\u2019.",
  "\u2022 Mentions including the de\ufb01nite article within the name entity span: \u2018the United States\u2019 versus \u2018United States\u2019. \u2022 Longer extents containing common nouns: in the MEANTIME corpus there are many entities such as \u201cUnited States airframer Boeing\u201d, which in this case is considered an organization, whereas in the training data this span will in general consists of two entities: \u2018United States\u2019 as location and \u2018Boeing\u2019 as organization. \u2022 Common nouns modifying the proper name: \u2018Spokeswoman Sandy Angers\u2019 is annotated as a named entity of type PER whereas in the training data used the span of the named entity would usually be \u2018Sandy Angers\u2019. CoNLL NER phrase based evaluation punishes any bracketing error as both false positive and negative. Thus, these span-related disagreements make this setting extremely hard for models trained according to other annotation guidelines, as shown by Table 18. Our baseline models degrade around 40 F1 points and the cluster-based models around 35. Other systems\u2019 results worsen much more, especially for Spanish and Dutch. The token-based scores are in general better but the proportion in performance between systems across languages is similar. 21",

  "Simple and shallow features These results are obtained without linguistic or global features. Instead, injecting unigram knowledge from the combination and stacking of clusters allows to obtain a robust NERC system across languages, outperforming other, more complex (Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Turian et al., 2010; Desmet and Hoste, 2014; Passos et al., 2014) and language-speci\ufb01c sys- tems. This is also the case for languages such as Basque or German, where the use of linguis- tic features (lemmas, POS tags, curated su\ufb03x lists and rules, etc.) has so far been pervasive (Alegria et al., 2006; Benikova et al., 2014, 2015).

  "has so far been pervasive (Alegria et al., 2006; Benikova et al., 2014, 2015). Minimal human intervention Each of the datasets used displays an idiosyncratic annotation and genre. This is even the case for the NER tasks organized at CoNLL 2002 and 2003: \u201cFor instance, Spanish marks no lowercase adjectival nationalities and includes 192 instances where surrounding quotes are included in the entity annotation; Dutch has as PER the initials of pho- tographers; and English has lots of \ufb01nancial and sports data in tables\u201d (Nothman et al., 2013). In despite of this, our best in-domain results were obtained using the same set of features for all seven evaluations, which included trigrams and character n-grams. The only variable across datasets and languages was the number of classes of the clustering lexicons used. However, the in-domain results also manifest that trigrams and character n-grams can be omitted for languages without declension cases or repeated su\ufb03xes in the named entities (e.g., Dutch, English and Spanish) without it being too detrimental.",
  "However, the in-domain results also manifest that trigrams and character n-grams can be omitted for languages without declension cases or repeated su\ufb03xes in the named entities (e.g., Dutch, English and Spanish) without it being too detrimental. In fact, we started experimenting without trigrams and character n-grams for Dutch, English and Spanish. When we added them to the best model of each language (e.g, charngram 1:6 en-91-18 in Table 5), the in-domain results improved or remained quite similar but at the cost of making the models less robust in the out- of-domain evaluations. In contrast, trigrams and character n-grams were highly bene\ufb01cial in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings for Basque and German. Our take on this issue is that trigram and character n-gram features would only be required to address in\ufb02ected named entities (in Basque) or to learn repeated su\ufb03xes appearing in named entities and to tackle sparsity (in both Basque and German).",
  "Our take on this issue is that trigram and character n-gram features would only be required to address in\ufb02ected named entities (in Basque) or to learn repeated su\ufb03xes appearing in named entities and to tackle sparsity (in both Basque and German). For example, Table 3 shows the utility of character n-gram features capturing the Basque locative declension case -ko, which is repeated for many location entities in the training data. The emphasis on clustering features for good performance (as opposed to local features) pro- duces an easily exportable and robust system for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations and across languages. It is therefore crucial, for competitive performance, to understand which clustering methods and corpora use as well as how to combine them e\ufb00ectively. Choosing the right corpus and clustering method Contrary to previous suggestions that the larger the number of classes and the corpus used to induced the clusters the better (Turian et al., 2010), our results provide a number of interesting pointers to choose the appropriate type of corpus and clustering method required for optimal performance. With respect to Brown clusters, all our results are better when we induce 1000 classes.",
  "With respect to Brown clusters, all our results are better when we induce 1000 classes. We systematically tried for every language and data source with less (320) and more (3200) classes without performance improvement. Moreover, in every evaluation setting the best results with Brown clusters were obtained when a corpus relatively closed in-domain, genre and date was used, even if signi\ufb01cantly smaller. This is especially clear for Basque, English and Spanish where the best Brown clusters were induced over the smallest corpora (Egunkaria, Reuters RCV1 and El Periodico, respectively). In contrast, results show that Word2vec clusters, unlike Brown, always bene\ufb01t from very large amounts of data, regardless of domain or temporal issues. Our experiments also suggest that Clark clusters seem to behave more robustly than Brown clusters with respect to the size and type of text, 23",
  "performing well with large unrelated and smaller domain-speci\ufb01c corpora. For best performance, Clark (2003) recommends that the proportion of clusters k with respect to the source data should be of k3 \u2248n where n is the number of words in the corpus. Instead, we systematically induce, for every corpus, Clark clusters in the range of 100-600 classes, because preliminary experiments proved that over 600 classes, even if the proportion proposed by Clark holds, performance starts to deteriorate15. Following this, we are now in better position to address the questions posed by Turian et al. (2010): \u2022 Brown clusters bene\ufb01t from source data closely related to the testset, even if small in size. \u2022 Clark clusters behave robustly with respect to the size or type of data sources from which they are induced. \u2022 For Word2vec clusters size is the most important factor: the larger the corpus the better. Should we prefer certain word features? While Clark features seem to obtain the best results overall, our work provides a very simple method of e\ufb00ectively combining them, depending on the data sources we have available.",
  "Should we prefer certain word features? While Clark features seem to obtain the best results overall, our work provides a very simple method of e\ufb00ectively combining them, depending on the data sources we have available. Combination and Stacking We use three di\ufb00erent data sources, namely, Wikipedia, Egunkaria and Berria (see Table 4 for the list of unlabeled corpora used) for the Basque experiments. In order to understand better our approach, we annotated the Basque testset with every model in Table 12 and manually inspected their output. The following two examples illustrate how our approach works: \u2022 Ekuadorko: In addition to the eu-cluster model, the Brown model (BE), and the Clark Wikipedia model (CW200) provide the correct annotation. The assigned clusters in BE and CW200 clustering lexicons clearly consist of locations.",

The assigned clusters in BE and CW200 clustering lexicons clearly consist of locations. For example, the 176 cluster of CW200 contains Gasteizko, Arabako, Espainiako, etc., which, unlike Ekuadorko, do occur in the training set.16 Most interestingly, while Gasteizko is only labeled as location in the training set, both Arabako and Espainiako are labeled as, depending on the context, organization or location. \u2022 Ameriketara (to America): Only the Brown model (and the eu-cluster) correctly labels it as a location. In this case, the 011110011100 Brown path clusters Ameriketara with other locations such as Baionara and Espainiara, among others, which, unlike Ameriketara, are contained in the training set.17 The same phenomenon can be observed for languages quite di\ufb00erent from Basque such as English or Spanish.",
  "For example, the named entity \u2018Uzbekistan\u2019 is not present in the English CoNLL 2003 training data, whereas in the test set can be found four times, all of them locations. The local model annotates all four occurrences as organization (see Table 5 for references to models). The Brown and the Word2vec models, two as locations and two as organizations, because the cluster companions of \u2018Uzbekistan\u2019 are of mixed nature. Finally, the Clark model (CW600) does correctly annotate them as locations (also best-cluster, en-91-18, en-91-36 . . .): \u2018Uzbekistan\u2019 is placed in the 145 cluster, which contains mostly locations contained in the training data (Spain, Ireland, etc.). 15Note that we did not experiment with any of the clustering algorithms\u2019 parameters, vector dimensions, etc, just with the number of classes. 16English: in Vitoria-Gasteiz, in Alava, in Spain. 17To Bayonne, to Spain. 24",
  "Previous approaches to NERC combining clusters or word embeddings have obtained mixed results (Turian et al., 2010). Up until now best results have been based on rather complex systems which also used one type clustering or embedding feature (Passos et al., 2014; Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Faruqui et al., 2010; Benikova et al., 2014). In other sequence labeling tasks, Biemann (2009) reports a slight improvement (from 97.33 to 97.43 word accuracy) in POS tagging combining two types of clustering methods (one of them was Clark (2003)) for German. Our system displays two important di\ufb00erences with respect to previous approaches. First, the di\ufb00erences between our baseline system and the, for example, Clark features are much larger than in previous work (with the exception of Faruqui et al. (2010)), ranging from 2.2 and 5.5 points in F1 measure across the in-domain evaluations to 2-8 points for out-of-domain results.",
  "(2010)), ranging from 2.2 and 5.5 points in F1 measure across the in-domain evaluations to 2-8 points for out-of-domain results. For example, our English CoNLL 2003 single clustering models are similar to the best CoNLL 2003 model distributed by the Stanford NER. If we consider the combined clustering models, the di\ufb00erences over the baseline increase to 5-10 points of F1 measure for in-domain evaluations and between 4-22 in out-of-domain settings. Second, our combination of clustering features signi\ufb01cantly increases the performance over the models using only one type of clustering feature. The improvements range over 2 to 6 points in F1 measure for in-domain and out-of-domain results. In our opinion, these results are quite interesting as previous experiments combining features of di\ufb00erent word representations for NERC (Turian et al., 2010), while increasing the overall result, did not improve over the state of the art at the time (Ratinov and Roth, 2009).",
  "The results also show that leaning heavily on the clustering features (instead of speci\ufb01c feature tuning) for performance proves very bene\ufb01cial in out-of-domain settings. Robust in out-of-domain settings The results of the eight out-of-domain evaluations under- taken suggest that di\ufb00erences regarding named entities spans as described in Section 4.3.3 are harder to overcome than disagreements in text genre (e.g. Section 4.3.2) or entity type (Section 4.3.1). Thus, our method using multiple clustering sources allow to overcome better any di\ufb00erences in named entity type or text genre. However, and even though our system obtains state of the art results in every evaluation, trying to adapt to di\ufb00erences in named entity shape and span proves to be a much more di\ufb03cult task, hence the comparatively lower results obtained in the MEANTIME evaluations. Robust reducing training data Koo et al.",
  "Robust reducing training data Koo et al. (2008) present learning curves showing the increase in performance when using Brown clusters for dependency parsing whereas Biemann (2009) pro- vides learning curves to measure the impact of clusters for NERC and chunking. Inspired by those two previous works we measured the performance when training data is reduced. Unlike these two approaches, the di\ufb00erences between adding clusters or not to our system with less training data is huge. Table 14 shows that di\ufb00erences adding the clustering features with half the data is around 8 points in F1 score (for Spanish the di\ufb00erence is 3.42 F1). Another common point of our clustering features with Koo et al. (2008) is that when gold training data is reduced, the system still obtains competitive results with respect to previous approaches or publicly available systems using only a fraction (half or a quarter) of the data.",
  "Another common point of our clustering features with Koo et al. (2008) is that when gold training data is reduced, the system still obtains competitive results with respect to previous approaches or publicly available systems using only a fraction (half or a quarter) of the data. If we consider the ability of our system to be competitive with substantial reductions in gold training data plus the fact that no linguistic motivated features are required, we are providing a system which is much cheaper to train for new languages and/or domains contributing therefore to alleviate the dependency on gold training data to obtain good performing NERC systems for new languages, domains or genres. 25",
  "6 Conclusion and Future Work We have shown how to develop robust NERC systems across languages and datasets with minimal human intervention, even for languages with in\ufb02ected named entities. This is based on adequately combining word representation features on top of shallow and general local features. Crucially, we have empirically demonstrate how to e\ufb00ectively combine various types of simple word represen- tation features depending on the source data available. This has resulted in a clear methodology for using the three types of clustering features which produces very competitive results in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Thus, despite the relative simplicity of our approach, we report state of the art results for Dutch, English, German, Spanish and Basque in seven in-domain evaluations. We also outperform previous work in eight out-of-domain evaluations, showing that our cluster- ing features improve the robustness of NERC systems across datasets. Finally, we have measured how much our system\u2019s performance degrades when the amount of supervised data is drastically cut. The results show our models are still very competitive even when reducing the supervised data by half or more.",
  "Finally, we have measured how much our system\u2019s performance degrades when the amount of supervised data is drastically cut. The results show our models are still very competitive even when reducing the supervised data by half or more. This, together with the lack of linguistic features, facilitates the easy and fast development of NERC systems for new domains or languages. In future work we would like to explore more the various types of domain adaptation required for robust performance across text genres and domains, perhaps including micro-blog and noisy text such as tweets. Furthermore, we are also planning to adapt our techniques to other sequence labeling problems such as Opinion Target Extraction (Pontiki et al., 2014, 2015) and Super Sense tagging (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).
