Approximately 30 million people in different countries speak the language. The lack of cor- pora is one of the main obstacles in Kurdish language processing. In this paper, we present KTC\u2013the Kurdish Textbooks Corpus, which is composed of 31 K-12 textbooks in Sorani dialect.

It is a less-resourced language (Salavati and Ahmadi, 2018), in other words, a language for which general-purpose grammars and raw internet-based corpora are the main existing resources. The language is spoken in \ufb01ve main dialects, namely, Kurmanji (aka Northern Kurdish), Sorani (aka Central Kurdish), Southern Kurdish, Zazaki and Gorani (Haig and \u00a8Opengin, 2014). Creating lexical databases and text corpora are essential tasks in natural language processing (NLP) development. Text corpora are knowledge repositories which provide semantic descriptions of words.",
            "Creating lexical databases and text corpora are essential tasks in natural language processing (NLP) development. Text corpora are knowledge repositories which provide semantic descriptions of words. The Kurdish language lacks diverse corpora in both raw and annotated forms (Esmaili et al., 2013; Hassani, 2018). According to the literature, there is no domain-speci\ufb01c corpus for Kurdish. In this paper, we present KTC, a domain-speci\ufb01c corpus containing K-12 textbooks in Sorani. We consider a domain as a set of related concepts, and a domain-speci\ufb01c corpus as a collection of docu- ments relevant to those concepts (Mason, 2004). Accordingly, we introduce KTC as a domain-speci\ufb01c corpus because it is based on the textbooks which have been written and compiled by a group of experts, appointed by the Ministry of Education (MoE) of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, for educational purposes at the K-12 level. The textbooks are selected, written, compiled, and edited by experts in each subject and also by language editors based on a uni\ufb01ed grammar and orthography.",
            "The textbooks are selected, written, compiled, and edited by experts in each subject and also by language editors based on a uni\ufb01ed grammar and orthography. This corpus was initially collected as an accurate source for developing a Sorani Kurdish spellchecker for scienti\ufb01c writing. KTC contains a range of subjects, and its content is categorized according to those subjects. Given the accuracy of the text from scienti\ufb01c, grammatical, and orthographic points of view, we believe that it is also a \ufb01ne-grained resource. The corpus will contribute to various NLP tasks in Kurdish, particularly in language modeling and grammatical error correction. In the rest of this paper, Section 2 reviews the related work, Section 3 presents the corpus, Section 4 addresses the challenges in the project and, Section 5 concludes the paper. *This paper was peer-reviewed and published by WiNLP19.",

            "2 Related work Although the initiative to create a corpus for Kurdish dates back to 1998 (Gautier, 1998), efforts in creating machine-readable corpora for Kurdish are recent. The \ufb01rst machine-readable corpus for Kurdish is the Leipzig Corpora Collection which is constructed using different sources on the Web (Biemann et al., 2007). Later, Pewan (Esmaili et al., 2013) and Bianet (Ataman, 2018) were developed as general-purpose corpora based on news articles. Kurdish corpora are also constructed for speci\ufb01c tasks such as dialectology (Malmasi, 2016; Hassani, 2018), machine transliteration (Ahmadi, 2019), and part-of-speech (POS) annotation (Walther and Sagot, 2010; Walther et al., 2010). However, to the best of our knowledge, currently, there is no domain-speci\ufb01c corpus for Kurdish dialects. 3 The Corpus KTC is composed of 31 educational textbooks published from 2011 to 2018 in various topics by the MoE.",

We received the material from the MoE partly in different versions of Microsoft Word and partly in Adobe InDesign formats. In the \ufb01rst step, we categorized each textbook based on the topics and chapters. As the original texts were not in Unicode, we converted the content to Unicode. This step was followed by a pre-processing stage where the texts were normalized by replacing zero-width-non-joiner (ZWNJ) (Esmaili et al., 2013) and manually verifying the orthography based on the reference orthography of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. In the normalization process, we did not remove punctuation and special characters so that the corpus can be easily adapted our current task and also to future tasks where the integrity of the text may be required.",

We highlight two main challenges we faced during the KTC development. First, most of the written Kurdish resources have not been digitized (Hassani et al., 2019), or they are either not publicly available or are not fully convertible. Second, Kurdish text processing suffers from different orthographic issues (Ahmadi, 2019) mainly due to the lack of standard orthography and the usage of non-Unicode keyboards.",
            "Second, Kurdish text processing suffers from different orthographic issues (Ahmadi, 2019) mainly due to the lack of standard orthography and the usage of non-Unicode keyboards. Therefore, we carried out a semi-automatic conversion, which made the process costly in terms of time and human assistance. 5 Conclusion We presented KTC\u2013the Kurdish Textbook Corpus, as the \ufb01rst domain-speci\ufb01c corpus for Sorani Kurdish. This corpus will pave the way for further developments in Kurdish language processing. We have mad the corpus available at https:\/\/github.com\/KurdishBLARK\/KTCfor non-commercial use. We are currently working on a project on the Sorani spelling error detection and correction. As future work, we are aiming to develop a similar corpus for all Kurdish dialects, particularly Kurmanji.
