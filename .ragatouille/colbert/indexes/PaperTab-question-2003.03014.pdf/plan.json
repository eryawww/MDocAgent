Despite these serious consequences and the wealth of available data, dehumanization has not yet been computationally studied on a large scale. Drawing upon social psychology research, we create a computational linguistic framework for analyzing dehumanizing language by identifying linguistic correlates of salient components of dehumanization. We then apply this framework to analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. Overall, we \ufb01nd increasingly humanizing descriptions of LGBTQ people over time.",
                "We then apply this framework to analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. Overall, we \ufb01nd increasingly humanizing descriptions of LGBTQ people over time. However, we \ufb01nd that the label homosexual has emerged to be much more strongly associated with dehumanizing attitudes than other labels, such as gay. Our proposed techniques highlight processes of linguistic variation and change in discourses surrounding marginalized groups. Furthermore, the ability to analyze dehumanizing language at a large scale has implications for automatically detecting and understanding media bias as well as abusive language online.

                "1 INTRODUCTION Despite the American public\u2019s increasing acceptance of LGBTQ people and recent legal successes, LGBTQ individuals remain targets of hate and violence (Dinakar et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2016; Gallup, 2019). At the core of this issue is dehumanization, \u201cthe act of perceiving or treating people as less than human\u201d (Haslam and Stratemeyer, 2016), a process that heavily contributes to extreme intergroup bias (Haslam, 2006). Language is central to studying this phenomenon; like other forms of bias (Wiebe et al., 2004; Greene and Resnik, 2009; Recasens et al., 2013; Voigt et al., 2017; Breitfeller et al., 2019), dehumanizing attitudes are expressed through subtle linguistic manipulations, even in carefully-edited texts. It is crucial to understand the use of such linguistic signals in mainstream media, as the media\u2019s representation of marginalized social groups has far-reaching implications for social acceptance, policy, and safety. While small-scale studies of dehumanization and media representation of marginalized communities provide valuable insights (e.g."
