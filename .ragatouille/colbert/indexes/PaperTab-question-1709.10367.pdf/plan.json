David Blei Columbia Univ. Abstract Word embeddings are a powerful approach for analyzing language, and exponential family embeddings (EFE) extend them to other types of data. Here we develop structured exponential family embeddings (S-EFE), a method for discovering embeddings that vary across related groups of data. We study how the word usage of U.S. Congressional speeches varies across states and party af\ufb01liation, how words are used differently across sections of the ArXiv, and how the co- purchase patterns of groceries can vary across seasons. Key to the success of our method is that the groups share statistical information. We develop two sharing strategies: hierarchical modeling and amortization. We demonstrate the bene\ufb01ts of this approach in empirical studies of speeches, abstracts, and shopping baskets. We show how S-EFE enables group-speci\ufb01c interpretation of word usage, and outperforms EFE in predicting held-out data.",

We show how S-EFE enables group-speci\ufb01c interpretation of word usage, and outperforms EFE in predicting held-out data. 1 Introduction Word embeddings (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2013d,c,a; Pennington et al., 2014; Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Arora et al., 2015) are unsupervised learning methods for capturing latent semantic structure in language. Word embedding methods analyze text data to learn distributed representations of the vocabulary that capture its co-occurrence statistics. These representations are useful for reasoning about word usage and meaning (Harris, 1954; Rumelhart et al., 1986). Word embeddings have also been extended to data beyond text (Barkan and Koenigstein, 2016; Rudolph et al., 2016), such as items in a grocery store or neurons in the brain.",
            "Word embeddings have also been extended to data beyond text (Barkan and Koenigstein, 2016; Rudolph et al., 2016), such as items in a grocery store or neurons in the brain. Exponential family embeddings (EFE) is a probabilistic perspective on embeddings that encompasses many existing methods and opens the door to bringing expressive probabilistic modeling (Bishop, 2006; Murphy, 2012) to the problem of learning distributed representations. We develop structured exponential family embeddings (S-EFE), an extension of EFE for studying how embeddings can vary across groups of related data. We will study several examples: in U.S. Congressional speeches, word usage can vary across states or party af\ufb01liations; in scienti\ufb01c literature, the usage patterns of technical terms can vary across \ufb01elds; in supermarket shopping data, co-purchase patterns of items can vary across seasons of the year. We will see that S-EFE discovers a per-group embedding representation of objects.",

While the na\u00efve approach of \ufb01tting an individual embedding model for each group would typically suffer from lack of data\u2014especially in groups for which fewer observations are available\u2014we develop two methods that can share information across groups. Figure 1a illustrates the kind of variation that we can capture. We \ufb01t an S-EFE to ArXiv abstracts grouped into different sections, such as computer science (cs), quantitative \ufb01nance (q-\ufb01n), and nonlinear sciences (nlin). S-EFE results in a per-section embedding of each term in the vocabulary. Using the \ufb01tted embeddings, we illustrate similar words to the word INTELLIGENCE. We can see that how INTELLIGENCE is used varies by \ufb01eld: in computer science the most similar words include ARTIFICIAL and AI; in \ufb01nance, similar words include ABILITIES and CONSCIOUSNESS. 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.",

We propose two methods to share statistical strength among the embedding vectors. The \ufb01rst approach is based on hierarchical modeling (Gelman et al., 2003), which assumes that the group- speci\ufb01c embedding representations are tied through a global embedding.

            "We use stochastic optimization to \ufb01t large data sets. Our work relates closely to two threads of research in the embedding literature. One is embedding methods that study how language evolves over time (Kim et al., 2014; Kulkarni et al., 2015; Hamilton et al., 2016; Rudolph and Blei, 2017; Bamler and Mandt, 2016; Yao et al., 2017). Time can be thought of as a type of \u201cgroup\u201d, though with evolutionary structure that we do not consider. The second thread is multilingual embeddings (Klementiev et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Ammar et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2013); our approach is different in that most words appear in all groups and we are interested in the variations of the embeddings across those groups.

We carry out a thorough experimental study on two text databases, ArXiv papers by section and U.S. Congressional speeches by home state and political party. Using Poisson embeddings, we study market basket data from a large grocery store, grouped by season. On all three data sets, S-EFE outperforms EFE in terms of held-out log-likelihood.

Having a separate embedding for each group allows us to study how the usage of a word like INTELLIGENCE varies across categories of the ArXiv, or which words are used most differently by U.S. Senators depending on which state they are from and whether they are Democrats or Republicans. The S-EFE model extends EFE to grouped data, by having the embedding vectors be speci\ufb01c for each group, while sharing the context vectors across all groups. We review the EFE model in Section 2.1. We then formalize the idea of sharing the context vectors in Section 2.2, where we present two approaches to build a hierarchical structure over the group-speci\ufb01c embeddings. 2.1 Background: Exponential Family Embeddings In exponential family embeddings, we have a collection of objects, and our goal is to learn a vector representation of these objects based on their co-occurrence patterns.

For example, in text, each column corresponds to a location in the text, and each entry xvi is a binary variable that indicates whether word v appears at location i. In EFE, we represent each object v with two sets of vectors, embeddings vectors \u03c1v[i] and context vectors \u03b1v[i], and we posit a probability distribution of data entries xvi in which these vectors interact. The de\ufb01nition of the EFE model requires three ingredients: a context, a conditional exponential family, and a parameter sharing structure. We next describe these three components. Exponential family embeddings learn the vector representation of objects based on the conditional probability of each observation, conditioned on the observations in its context. The context cvi gives the indices of the observations that appear in the conditional probability distribution of xvi. The de\ufb01nition of the context varies across applications.",

The context cvi gives the indices of the observations that appear in the conditional probability distribution of xvi. The de\ufb01nition of the context varies across applications. In text, it corresponds to the set of words in a \ufb01xed-size window centered at location i. Given the context cvi and the corresponding observations xcvi indexed by cvi, the distribution for xvi is in the exponential family, xvi | xcvi \u223cExpFam (t(xvi), \u03b7v(xcvi)) , (1) with suf\ufb01cient statistics t(xvi) and natural parameter \u03b7v(xcvi). The parameter vectors interact in the conditional probability distributions of each observation xvi as follows.",
            "The parameter vectors interact in the conditional probability distributions of each observation xvi as follows.

            "2.2 Structured Exponential Family Embeddings Here, we describe the S-EFE model for grouped data. In text, some examples of grouped data are Congressional speeches grouped into political parties or scienti\ufb01c documents grouped by discipline. Our goal is to learn group-speci\ufb01c embeddings from data partitioned into S groups, i.e., each instance i is associated with a group si \u2208{1, . . . , S}. The S-EFE model extends EFE to learn a separate set of embedding vectors for each group. To build the S-EFE model, we impose a particular parameter sharing structure over the set of embedding and context vectors. We posit a structured model in which the context vectors are shared across groups, i.e., \u03b1v[i] \u2261\u03b1v (as in the standard EFE model), but the embedding vectors are only shared at the group level, i.e., for an observation i belonging to group si, \u03c1v[i] \u2261\u03c1(si) v . Here, \u03c1(s) v denotes the embedding vector corresponding to group s. We show a graphical representation of the S-EFE in Figure 1b.",
            "Here, \u03c1(s) v denotes the embedding vector corresponding to group s. We show a graphical representation of the S-EFE in Figure 1b. Sharing the context vectors \u03b1v has two advantages. First, the shared structure reduces the number of parameters, while the resulting S-EFE model is still \ufb02exible to capture how differently words are used across different groups, as \u03c1(s) v is allowed to vary.1 Second, it has the important effect of uniting all embedding parameters in the same space, as the group-speci\ufb01c vectors \u03c1(s) v need to agree with the components of \u03b1v. While one could learn a separate embedding model for each group, as has been done for text grouped into time slices (Kim et al., 2014; Kulkarni et al., 2015; Hamilton et al., 2016), this approach would require ad-hoc postprocessing steps to align the embeddings.2 When there are S groups, the S-EFE model has S times as many embedding vectors than the standard embedding model. This may complicate inferences about the group-speci\ufb01c vectors, especially for groups with less data.",
            "This may complicate inferences about the group-speci\ufb01c vectors, especially for groups with less data. Additionally, an object v may appear with very low frequency in a particular group. Thus, the na\u00efve approach for building the S-EFE model without additional structure may be detrimental for the quality of the embeddings, especially for small-sized groups. To address this problem, we propose two different methods to tie the individual \u03c1(s) v together, sharing statistical strength among them. The \ufb01rst approach consists in a hierarchical embedding structure. The second approach is based on amortization. In both methods, we introduce a set of global embedding vectors \u03c1(0) v , and impose a particular structure to generate \u03c1(s) v from \u03c1(0) v . Hierarchical embedding structure. Here, we impose a hierarchical structure that allows sharing statistical strength among the per-group variables. For that, we assume that each \u03c1(s) v \u223cN(\u03c1(0) v , \u03c32 \u03c1I), where \u03c32 \u03c1 is a \ufb01xed hyperparameter. Thus, we replace the EFE objective function in Eq.",

Thus, we replace the EFE objective function in Eq. 3 with Lhier = log p(\u03b1) + log p(\u03c1(0)) + X s log p(\u03c1(s) | \u03c1(0)) + X v,i log p \u0000xvi \f\f xcvi; \u03b1, \u03c1 \u0001 . (4) where the \u21132-regularization term now applies only on \u03b1v and the global vectors \u03c1(0) v . Fitting the hierarchical model involves maximizing Eq. 4 with respect to \u03b1v, \u03c1(0) v , and \u03c1(s) v . We note that we have not reduced the number of parameters to be inferred; rather, we tie them together through a common prior distribution. We use stochastic gradient ascent to maximize Eq. 4. Amortization.",
            "We note that we have not reduced the number of parameters to be inferred; rather, we tie them together through a common prior distribution. We use stochastic gradient ascent to maximize Eq. 4. Amortization. The idea of amortization has been applied in the literature to develop amortized inference algorithms (Dayan et al., 1995; Gershman and Goodman, 2014). The main insight behind amortization is to reuse inferences about past experiences when presented with a new task, leveraging the accumulated knowledge to quickly solve the new problem. Here, we use amortization to control the number of parameters of the S-EFE model. In particular, we set the per-group embeddings \u03c1(s) v to be the output of a deterministic function of the global embedding vectors, \u03c1(s) v = fs(\u03c1(0) v ). We use a different function fs(\u00b7) for each group s, and we parameterize them using neural networks, similarly to other works on amortized inference (Korattikara et al., 2015; Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Mnih and Gregor, 2014).",
            "Unlike standard uses of amortized inference, in S-EFE the 1Alternatively, we could share the embedding vectors \u03c1v and have group-speci\ufb01c context vectors \u03b1(s) v . We did not explore that avenue and leave it for future work. 2Another potential advantage of the proposed parameter sharing structure is that, when the context vectors are held \ufb01xed, the resulting objective function is convex, by the convexity properties of exponential families (Wainwright and Jordan, 2008). 4",
            "input to the functions fs(\u00b7) is unobserved and must be estimated together with the parameters of the functions fs(\u00b7). Depending on the architecture of the neural networks, the amortization can signi\ufb01cantly reduce the number of parameters in the model (as compared to the non-amortized model), while still having the \ufb02exibility to model different embedding vectors for each group. The number of parameters in the S-EFE model is KL(S + 1), where S is the number of groups, K is the dimensionality of the embedding vectors, and L is the number of objects (e.g., the vocabulary size). With amortization, we reduce the number of parameters to 2KL + SP, where P is the number of parameters of the neural network. Since typically L \u226bP, this corresponds to a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the number of parameters, even when P scales linearly with K. In the amortized S-EFE model, we need to introduce a new set of parameters \u03c6(s) \u2208RP for each group s, corresponding to the neural network parameters.",
            "Given these, the group-speci\ufb01c embedding vectors \u03c1(s) v are obtained as \u03c1(s) v = fs(\u03c1(0) v ) = f(\u03c1(0) v ; \u03c6(s)). (5) We compare two architectures for the function fs(\u00b7): fully connected feed-forward neural networks and residual networks (He et al., 2016).

In embedding models, we ignore this one-hot constraint for computational ef\ufb01ciency, and consider that the observations are generated following a set of conditional Bernoulli distributions (Mikolov et al., 2013c; Rudolph et al., 2016). Given that most of the entries in X are zero, embedding models typically downweigh the contribution of the zeros to the objective function. Mikolov et al.

            "Data. We apply the S-EFE on three datasets: ArXiv papers, U.S. Senate speeches, and purchases on supermarket grocery shopping data. We describe these datasets below, and we provide a summary of the datasets in Table 1. ArXiv papers: This dataset contains the abstracts of papers published on the ArXiv under the 19 different tags between April 2007 and June 2015. We treat each tag as a group and \ufb01t S-EFE with the goal of uncovering which words have the strongest shift in usage. We split the abstracts into training, validation, and test sets, with proportions of 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Senate speeches: This dataset contains U.S. Senate speeches from 1994 to mid 2009. In contrast to the ArXiv collection, it is a transcript of spoken language. We group the data into state of origin of the speaker and his or her party af\ufb01liation. Only af\ufb01liations with the Republican and Democratic Party are considered. As a result, there are 83 groups (Republicans from Alabama, Democrats from Alabama, Republicans from Arkansas, etc.).",

For text we set the dimension of the embeddings to K = 100, the number of hidden units to H = 25, and we experiment with two context sizes, 2 and 8.4 In the shopping data, we use K = 50 and H = 20, and we randomly truncate the context of baskets larger than 20 to reduce their size to 20. For both methods, we use 20 negative samples. For all methods, we subsample minibatches of data in the same manner. Each minibatch contains subsampled observations from all groups and each group is subsampled proportionally to its size.

This sampling scheme reduces the bias from imbalanced group sizes. For text, we use a minibatch size of N\/10000, where N is the size of the corpus, and we run 5 passes over the data; for the shopping data we use N\/100 and run 50 passes.

The weights are drawn from a uniform distribution bounded at \u00b1 \u221a 6\/ \u221a K + H (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). For the embeddings, we try 3 initialization schemes and choose the best one based on validation error.

Finally, for each method we choose the regularization variance from the set {100, 10, 1, 0.1}, also based on validation error. Runtime. We implemented all methods in Tensor\ufb02ow. On the Senate speeches, the runtime of S-EFE is 4.3 times slower than the runtime of global EFE, hierarchical EFE is 4.6 times slower than the runtime of global EFE, and amortized S-EFE is 3.3 times slower than the runtime of global EFE.

For each model, we compute the test pseudo log-likelihood, according to the exponential family distribution used (Bernoulli or Poisson). For each test entry, a better model will assign higher probability to the observed word or item, and lower probability to the negative samples. This is a fair metric because the competing methods all produce conditional likelihoods from the same exponential family.6 To make results comparable, we train and evaluate all methods with the same number of negative samples (20). The reported held out likelihoods give equal weight to the positive and negative samples. Quantitative results.

The results of the global EFE baseline are better than \ufb01tting separate EFE (the other baseline), but unlike the other methods the global EFE cannot be used for the exploratory analysis of variations across groups.

            "While both hierarchical S-EFE and amortized S-EFE share information about the embedding of a particular word across groups (through the global embedding \u03c1(0) v ), amortization additionally ties the embeddings of all words within a group (through learning the neural network of that group). We hypothesize that for the Senate speeches, which are split into many groups, this is a strong modeling constraint, while it helps for all other experiments. Structured embeddings reveal a spectrum of word usage. We have motivated S-EFE with the example that the usage of INTELLIGENCE varies by ArXiv category (Figure 1a). We now explain how for each term the per-group embeddings place the groups on a spectrum. For a speci\ufb01c term v we take its embeddings vectors {\u03c1(s) v } for all groups s, and project them onto a one-dimensional space using the \ufb01rst component of principal component analysis (PCA). This is a one-dimensional summary of how close the embeddings of v are across groups.

(The embeddings come from a \ufb01tted S-EFE with feed-forward amortization.) We can see that in an unsupervised manner, the method has placed together groups related to physics on one end on the spectrum, while computer science, statistics and math are on the other end of the spectrum. To give additional intuition of what the usage of INTELLIGENCE is at different locations on the spectrum, we have listed the 8 most similar words for the groups computer science (cs), quantitative \ufb01nance (q-\ufb01n), math (math), statistics (stat), and nonlinear sciences (nlin).

Exploring group variations with structured embeddings. The result of the S-EFE also allows us to investigate which words have the highest deviation from their average usage for each group.

We might however want to ask a question like \u201cwhich words do Republicans from Texas use most differently from other Senators?\u201d By suggesting an answer, our method can guide an exploratory data analysis.

            "Table 3 shows a summary of our \ufb01ndings (the full table is in the Appendix). According to the S-EFE (with residual network amortization), Republican Senators from Texas use BORDER and the phrase OUR COUNTRY in different contexts than other Senators. Some of these variations are probably in\ufb02uenced by term frequency, as we expect Democrats from Washington to talk about WASHINGTON more frequently than other states. But we argue that our method provides more insights than a frequency based analysis, as it is also sensitive to the context in which a word appears. For example, WASHINGTON might in some groups be used more often in the context of PRESIDENT and GEORGE, while in others it might appear in the context of DC and CAPITAL, or it may refer to the state. 4 Discussion We have presented several structured extensions of EFE for modeling grouped data.

            "4 Discussion We have presented several structured extensions of EFE for modeling grouped data. Hierarchical S-EFE can capture variations in word usage across groups while sharing statistical strength between them through a hierarchical prior. Amortization is an effective way to reduce the number of parameters in the hierarchical model. The amortized S-EFE model leverages the expressive power of neural networks to reduce the number of parameters, while still having the \ufb02exibility to capture variations between the embeddings of each group. Below are practical guidelines for choosing a S-EFE. How can I \ufb01t embeddings that vary across groups of data? To capture variations across groups, never \ufb01t a separate embedding model for each group. We recommend at least sharing the context vectors, as all the S-EFE models do. This ensures that the latent dimensions of the embeddings are aligned across groups. In addition to sharing context vectors, we also recommend sharing statistical strength between the embedding vectors. In this paper we have presented two ways to do so, hierarchical modeling and amortization. Should I use a hierarchical prior or amortization? The answer depends on how many groups the data contain.",
            "In addition to sharing context vectors, we also recommend sharing statistical strength between the embedding vectors. In this paper we have presented two ways to do so, hierarchical modeling and amortization. Should I use a hierarchical prior or amortization? The answer depends on how many groups the data contain. In our experiments, the hierarchical S-EFE works better when there are many groups. With less groups, the amortized S-EFE works better. The advantage of the amortized S-EFE is that it has fewer parameters than the hierarchical model, while still having the \ufb02exibility to capture across-group variations. The global embeddings in an amortized S-EFE have two roles. They capture the semantic similarities of the words, and they also serve as the input into the amortization networks. Thus, the global embeddings of words with similar pattern of across-group variation need to be in regions of the embedding space that lead to similar modi\ufb01cations by the amortization network. As the number of groups in the data increases, these two roles become harder to balance. We hypothesize that this is why the amortized S-EFE has stronger performance when there are fewer groups.",

To amortize a S-EFE we recommend residual networks. They perform better than the feed-forward networks in all of our experiments. While the feed-forward network has to output the entire meaning of a word in the group-speci\ufb01c embedding, the residual network only needs the capacity to model how the group-speci\ufb01c embedding differs from the global embedding.
