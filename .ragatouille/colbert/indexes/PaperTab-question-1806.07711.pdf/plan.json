            "Categorization of Semantic Roles for Dictionary De\ufb01nitions Vivian S. Silva, Siegfried Handschuh and Andr\u00b4e Freitas Department of Computer Science and Mathematics University of Passau Innstra\u00dfe 43, 94032, Passau, Germany {vivian.santossilva, siegfried.handschuh, andre.freitas}@uni-passau.de Abstract Understanding the semantic relationships between terms is a fundamental task in natural lan- guage processing applications. While structured resources that can express those relationships in a formal way, such as ontologies, are still scarce, a large number of linguistic resources gathering dictionary de\ufb01nitions is becoming available, but understanding the semantic structure of natural language de\ufb01nitions is fundamental to make them useful in semantic interpretation tasks. Based on an analysis of a subset of WordNet\u2019s glosses, we propose a set of semantic roles that compose the semantic structure of a dictionary de\ufb01nition, and show how they are related to the de\ufb01nition\u2019s syntactic con\ufb01guration, identifying patterns that can be used in the development of information extraction frameworks and semantic models.",
            "1 Introduction Many natural language understanding tasks such as Text Entailment and Question Answering systems are dependent on the interpretation of the semantic relationships between terms. The challenge on the construction of robust semantic interpretation models is to provide a model which is both comprehensive (capture a large set of semantic relations) and \ufb01ne-grained. While semantic relations (high-level binary predicates which express relationships between words) can serve as a semantic interpretation model, in many cases, the relationship between words cannot be fully articulated as a single semantic relation, depending on a contextualization that involves one or more target words, their corresponding semantic relationships and associated logical operators (e.g. modality, functional operators). Natural language de\ufb01nitions of terms, such as dictionary de\ufb01nitions, are resources that are still under- utilized in the context of semantic interpretation tasks. The high availability of natural language de\ufb01ni- tions in different domains of discourse, in contrast to the scarcity of comprehensive structured resources such as ontologies, make them a candidate linguistic resource to provide a data source for \ufb01ne-grained semantic models.",
            "The high availability of natural language de\ufb01ni- tions in different domains of discourse, in contrast to the scarcity of comprehensive structured resources such as ontologies, make them a candidate linguistic resource to provide a data source for \ufb01ne-grained semantic models. Under this context, understanding the syntactic and semantic \u201cshape\u201d of natural language de\ufb01nitions, i.e., how de\ufb01nitions are usually expressed, is fundamental for the extraction of structured representations and for the construction of semantic models from these data sources. This paper aims at \ufb01lling this gap by providing a systematic analysis of the syntactic and semantic structure of natural language de\ufb01nitions and proposing a set of semantic roles for them. By semantic role here we mean entity-centered roles, that is, roles representing the part played by an expression in a de\ufb01nition, showing how it relates to the entity being de\ufb01ned. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), one of the most employed linguistic resources in semantic applications, was used as a corpus for this task.",
            "WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), one of the most employed linguistic resources in semantic applications, was used as a corpus for this task. The analysis points out the syntactic and semantic regularity of de\ufb01nitions, making explicit an enumerable set of syntactic and semantic patterns which can be used to derive information extraction frameworks and semantic models. The contributions of this paper are: (i) a systematic preliminary study of syntactic and semantic rela- tionships expressed in a corpus of de\ufb01nitions, (ii) the derivation of semantic categories for the classi\ufb01ca- tion of semantic patterns within de\ufb01nitions, and (iii) the description of the main syntactic and semantic shapes present in de\ufb01nitions, along with the quanti\ufb01cation of the distribution of these patterns.

            "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic structural aspects of de\ufb01nitions ac- cording to the classic theory of de\ufb01nitions. Section 3 introduces the proposed set of semantic roles for de\ufb01nitions. Section 4 outlines the relationship between semantic and syntactic patterns. Section 5 lists related work, followed by the conclusions and future work in Section 6. 2 Structural Aspects of De\ufb01nitions Swartz (1997) describe lexical, or dictionary de\ufb01nitions as reports of common usage (or usages) of a term, and argue that they allow the improvement and re\ufb01nement of the use of language, because they can be used to increase vocabulary (introducing people to the meaning and use of words new to them), to eliminate certain kinds of ambiguity and to reduce vagueness. A clear and properly structured de\ufb01nition can also provide the necessary identity criteria to correctly allocate an entity in an ontologically well- de\ufb01ned taxonomy (Guarino and Welty, 2002).",
            "A clear and properly structured de\ufb01nition can also provide the necessary identity criteria to correctly allocate an entity in an ontologically well- de\ufb01ned taxonomy (Guarino and Welty, 2002). Some linguistic resources, such as WordNet, organize concepts in a taxonomy, so the genus-differentia de\ufb01nition pattern would be a suitable way to represent the subsumption relationship among them. The genus and differentia concepts date back to Aristotle\u2019s writings concerning the theory of de\ufb01nition (Berg, 1982; Granger, 1984; Lloyd, 1962) and are most commonly used to describe entities in the biology domain, but they are general enough to de\ufb01ne concepts in any \ufb01eld of knowledge. An example of a genus-differentia based de\ufb01nition is the Aristotelian de\ufb01nition of a human: \u201ca human is a rational animal\u201d. Animal is the genus, and rational is the differentia distinguishing humans from other animals. Another important aspect of the theory of de\ufb01nition is the distinction between essential and non- essential properties.",
            "Animal is the genus, and rational is the differentia distinguishing humans from other animals. Another important aspect of the theory of de\ufb01nition is the distinction between essential and non- essential properties. As pointed by Burek (2004), stating that \u201ca human is an animal\u201d informs an essential property for a human (being an animal), but the sentence \u201chuman is civilized\u201d does not communicate a fundamental property, but rather something that happens to be true for humans, that is, an incidental property. Analyzing a subset of the WordNet de\ufb01nitions to investigate their structure, we noticed that most of them loosely adhere to the classical theory of de\ufb01nition: with the exception of some samples of what could be called ill-formed de\ufb01nitions, in general they are composed by a linguistic structure that resembles the genus-differentia pattern, plus optional and variable incidental properties. Based on this analysis, we derived a set of semantic roles representing the components of a lexical de\ufb01nition, which are described next.",
            "Based on this analysis, we derived a set of semantic roles representing the components of a lexical de\ufb01nition, which are described next. 3 Semantic Roles for Lexical De\ufb01nitions De\ufb01nitions in WordNet don\u2019t follow a strict pattern: they can be constructed in terms of the entity\u2019s immediate superclass or rather using a more abstract ancestral class. For this reason, we opted for using the more general term supertype instead of the classical genus. A supertype is either the immediate entity\u2019s superclass, as in \u201cfootwear: clothing worn on a person\u2019s feet\u201d, being footwear immediately under clothing in the taxonomy; or an ancestral, as in \u201cilliterate: a person unable to read\u201d, where illiterate is three levels below person in the hierarchy. Two different types of distinguishing features stood out in the analyzed de\ufb01nitions, so the differentia component was split into two roles: differentia quality and differentia event. A differentia quality is an essential, inherent property that distinguishes the entity from the others under the same supertype, as in \u201cbaseball coach: a coach of baseball players\u201d.",
            "A differentia quality is an essential, inherent property that distinguishes the entity from the others under the same supertype, as in \u201cbaseball coach: a coach of baseball players\u201d. A differentia event is an action, state or process in which the entity participates and that is mandatory to distinguish it from the others under the same supertype. It is also essential and is more common for (but not restricted to) entities denoting roles, as in \u201croadhog: a driver who obstructs others\u201d. As any expression describing events, a differentia event can have several subcomponents, denoting time, location, mode, etc. Although many roles could be derived, we opted to specify only the ones that were more recurrent and seemed to be more relevant for the de\ufb01nitions\u2019 classi\ufb01cation: event time and event location. Event time is the time in which a differentia event happens, as in \u201cmaster of ceremonies: a person who acts as host at formal occasions\u201d; and event location is the location of a differentia event, as in \u201cfrontiersman: a man who lives on the frontier\u201d.",
            "A quality modi\ufb01er can also be considered a subcomponent of a differentia quality: it is a degree, frequency or manner modi\ufb01er that constrain a differentia quality, as in \u201cdart: run or move very quickly or hastily\u201d, where very narrows down the differentia quality quickly associated to the supertypes run and move. The origin location role can be seen as a particular type of differentia quality that determines the entity\u2019s location of origin, but in most of the cases it doesn\u2019t seem to be an essential property, that is, the entity only happens to occur or come from a given location, and this fact doesn\u2019t account to its essence, as in \u201cBartramian sandpiper: large plover-like sandpiper of North American \ufb01elds and uplands\u201d, where large and plover-like are essential properties to distinguish Bartramian sandpiper from other sandpipers, but occurring in North American \ufb01elds and uplands is only an incidental property. The purpose role determines the main goal of the entity\u2019s existence or occurrence, as in \u201credundancy: repetition of messages to reduce the probability of errors in transmission\u201d.",
            "The purpose role determines the main goal of the entity\u2019s existence or occurrence, as in \u201credundancy: repetition of messages to reduce the probability of errors in transmission\u201d. A purpose is different from a differentia event in the sense that it is not essential: in the mentioned example, a repetition of messages that fails to reduce the probability of errors in transmission is still a redundancy, but in \u201cwater faucet: a faucet for drawing water from a pipe or cask\u201d, for drawing water is a differentia event, because a faucet that fails this condition is not a water faucet. Another event that is also non-essential, but rather brings only additional information to the de\ufb01nition is the associated fact, a fact whose occurrence is\/was linked to the entity\u2019s existence or occurrence, ac- counting as an incidental attribute, as in \u201cMohorovicic: Yugoslav geophysicist for whom the Mohorovicic discontinuity was named\u201d.",
            "Other minor, non-essential roles identi\ufb01ed in our analysis are: accessory determiner, a determiner expression that doesn\u2019t constrain the supertype-differentia scope, as in \u201ccamas: any of several plants of the genus Camassia\u201d, where the expression any of several could be removed without any loss in the de\ufb01nition meaning; accessory quality, a quality that is not essential to characterize the entity, as in \u201cAllium: large genus of perennial and biennial pungent bulbous plants\u201d, where large is only an incidental property; and [role] particle, a particle, such as a phrasal verb complement, non-contiguous to the other role components, as in \u201cunstaple: take the staples off\u201d, where the verb take off is split in the de\ufb01nition, being take the supertype and off a supertype particle. The conceptual model in Figure 1 shows the relationship among roles, and between roles and the de\ufb01niendum, that is, the entity being de\ufb01ned. Figure 1: Conceptual model for the semantic roles for lexical de\ufb01nitions.",

Figure 1: Conceptual model for the semantic roles for lexical de\ufb01nitions. Relationships between [role] particle and every other role in the model are expressed as dashed lines for readability.",
            "4 Identifying Semantic Roles in De\ufb01nitions Once the relevant semantic roles were identi\ufb01ed in the manual analysis, the following question emerged: is it possible to extend this classi\ufb01cation to the whole de\ufb01nitions database through automated Semantic Role Labelling? Although most SRL systems rely on ef\ufb01cient machine learning techniques (Palmer et al., 2010), an initial, preferably large, amount of annotated data is necessary for the training phase. Since manual annotation is expensive, an alternative would be a rule-based mechanism to automati- cally label the de\ufb01nitions, based on their syntactic structure, followed by a manual curation of the gen- erated data. As shown in an experimental study by Punyakanok et al. (2005), syntactic parsing provides fundamental information for event-centered SRL, and, in fact, this is also true for entity-centered SRL.",
            "As shown in an experimental study by Punyakanok et al. (2005), syntactic parsing provides fundamental information for event-centered SRL, and, in fact, this is also true for entity-centered SRL. To draw the relationship between syntactic and semantic structure (as well as de\ufb01ning the set of relevant roles described earlier), we randomly selected a sample of 100 glosses from the WordNet nouns+verbs database1, being 84 nouns and 16 verbs (the verb database size is only approximately 17% of the noun database size). First, we manually annotated each of the glosses, assigning to each segment in the sentence the most suitable role. Example sentences and parentheses were not included in the clas- si\ufb01cation. Figure 2 shows an example of annotated gloss. Then, using the Stanford parser (Manning et al., 2014), we generated the syntactic parse trees for all the 100 glosses and compared the semantic patterns with their syntactic counterparts.

            "Figure 2: Example of role labeling for the de\ufb01nition of the \u201clake poets\u201d synset. Table 1 shows the distribution of the semantic patterns for the analyzed sample. As can be seen, (supertype) (differentia quality) and (supertype) (differentia event) are the most frequent patterns, but many others are composed by a combination of three or more roles, usually the supertype, one or more differentia qualities and\/or differentia events, and any of the other roles. Since most of them occurred only once (29 out of 42 identi\ufb01ed patterns), it is easier to analyze the roles as independent components, regardless of the pattern where they appear. The context can always give some hint about what a role is, but we would expect the role\u2019s main characteristics not to change when their \u201ccompanions\u201d in the sentence varies.",
            "The context can always give some hint about what a role is, but we would expect the role\u2019s main characteristics not to change when their \u201ccompanions\u201d in the sentence varies. The conclusions are as follows2, and are summarized in Table 2: Supertype: it\u2019s mandatory in a well-formed de\ufb01nition, and indeed 99 out of the 100 sentences ana- lyzed have a supertype (the gloss for Tertiary period \u2013 \u201cfrom 63 million to 2 million years ago\u201d lacks a supertype and could, then, be considered an ill-formed de\ufb01nition). For verbs, it is the leftmost VB and, in some cases, subsequent VBs preceded by a CC (\u201cor\u201d or \u201cand\u201d). This is the case whenever the parser correctly classi\ufb01es the gloss\u2019 head word as a verb (11 out of 16 sentences). For nouns, in most cases (70 out of 83) the supertype is contained in the innermost and leftmost NP containing at least one NN. It is the whole NP (discarding leading DTs) if it exists as an entry in WN, or the largest rightmost sequence that exists in WN otherwise.",
            "It is the whole NP (discarding leading DTs) if it exists as an entry in WN, or the largest rightmost sequence that exists in WN otherwise. In the last case, the remaining leftmost words correspond to one or more differentia qualities. If the NP contains CCs, more than one supertype exist, and can be identi\ufb01ed follow- ing the same rules just described. The 13 sentences that don\u2019t \ufb01t this scenario include some non-frequent grammatical variations, parser errors and the presence of accessory determiners, described later. Differentia quality: for verbs, this is the most common identifying component in the de\ufb01nition. It occurs in 14 out of the 16 sentences. The other two ones are composed by a single supertype (that would better be seen as a synonym), and by a conjunction of two supertypes.

For nouns, two scenarios outstand: the differentia quality preceding the supertype, where it is composed by the leftmost words in the same NP that contains the supertype but are not part of the supertype itself, as described above; and the differentia quality coming after the supertype, predominantly composed by a PP, where the prevailing introductory preposition is \u201cof\u201d. These two scenarios cover approximately 90% of all analyzed sentences where one or more differentia qualities occur. Differentia event: differentia events occurs only for nouns, since verbs can\u2019t represent entities that can participate in an event (i.e., endurants in the ontological view).

In the remaining samples, the differentia event is also composed by a VP, but under a PP and immediately after the introductory preposition. Event location: event locations only occur in conjunction with a differentia event, so they will usually be composed by a PP appearing inside a SBAR or a VP. Being attached to a differentia event helps to distinguish an event location from other roles also usually composed by a PP, but additional character- istics can also provide some clues, like, for example, the presence of named entities denoting locations, such as \u201cMorocco\u201d and \u201cLake District\u201d, which appear in some of the analyzed glosses. Event time: the event time role has the same characteristics of event locations: only occurs in conjunc- tion with a differentia event and is usually composed by a PP inside a SBAR or a VP.",
            "Event time: the event time role has the same characteristics of event locations: only occurs in conjunc- tion with a differentia event and is usually composed by a PP inside a SBAR or a VP.

Origin location: origin locations are similar to event locations, but occurring in the absence of an event, so it is usually a PP that does not appear inside a SBAR or a VP and that frequently contains named entities denoting locations, like \u201cUnited States\u201d, \u201cBalkan Peninsula\u201d and \u201cFrance\u201d in our sample glosses. A special case is the de\ufb01nition of entities denoting instances, where the origin location usually comes before the supertype and is composed by a NP (also frequently containing some named entity), like the de\ufb01nitions for Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman \u2013 \u201cUnited States feminist\u201d \u2013 and Joseph Hooker \u2013 \u201cUnited States general [. . . ]\u201d, for example.",

A syntactic dependency parsing can show whether some modi\ufb01er (usually an adjective or adverb) references, instead of the supertype, some of the differentia quality\u2019s elements, modifying it. Purpose: the purpose component is usually composed by a VP beginning with a TO (\u201cto\u201d) or a PP beginning with the preposition \u201cfor\u201d and having a VP right after it. In a syntactic parse tree, a purpose can easily be mistaken by a differentia event, since the difference between them is semantic (the differentia event is essential to de\ufb01ne the entity, and the purpose only provide additional, non-essential information). Since it provides complementary information, it should always occur in conjunction with an identifying role, that is, a differentia quality and\/or event. Previously detecting these identifying roles in the de\ufb01nition, although not suf\ufb01cient, is necessary to correctly assign the purpose role to a de\ufb01nition\u2019s segment.

Again, the difference between an associated fact and a differentia event is semantic, and the same conditions and principles for identifying a purpose component also apply. Accessory determiner: accessory determiners come before the supertype and are easily recognizable when they don\u2019t contain any noun, like \u201cany of several\u201d, for example: it will usually be the whole expression before the supertype, which, in this case, is contained in the innermost and leftmost NP having at least one NN.

In this case, a more extensive analysis in the WN database to collect the most common expressions used as accessory determiners is necessary in order to provide further information for the correct role assignment. Accessory quality: the difference between accessory qualities and differentia qualities is purely se- mantic. It is usually a single adjective, but the syntactic structure can\u2019t help beyond that in the accessory quality identi\ufb01cation. Again, the presence of an identifying element in the de\ufb01nition (preferably a dif- ferentia quality) associated with knowledge about most common words used as accessory qualities can provide important evidences for the correct role detection.

            "5 Related Work The task described in this work is a form of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), but centered on entities instead of events. Typically, SRL has as primary goal to identify what semantic relations hold among a predicate (the main verb in a clause) and its associated participants and properties (M`arquez et al., 2008). Focusing on determining \u201cwho\u201d did \u201cwhat\u201d to \u201cwhom\u201d, \u201cwhere\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d, and \u201chow\u201d, the labels de\ufb01ned for this task include agent, theme, force, result and instrument, among others (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000). Liu and Ng (2007) perform SRL focusing on nouns instead of verbs, but most noun predicates in NomBank, which were used in the task, are verb nominalizations. This leads to the same event-centered role labeling, and the same principles and labels used for verbs apply. Kordjamshidi et al. (2010) describe a non-event-centered semantic role labeling task.",
            "This leads to the same event-centered role labeling, and the same principles and labels used for verbs apply. Kordjamshidi et al. (2010) describe a non-event-centered semantic role labeling task. They focus on spatial relations between objects, de\ufb01ning roles such as trajectory, landmark, region, path, motion, direction and frame of reference, and develop an approach to annotate sentences containing spatial de- scriptions, extracting topological, directional and distance relations from their content. Regarding the structural aspects of lexical de\ufb01nitions, Bodenreider and Burgun (2002) present an analysis of the structure of biological concept de\ufb01nitions from different sources. They restricted the analysis to anatomical concepts to check to what extent they \ufb01t the genus-differentia pattern, the most common method used to classify living organisms, and what the other common structures employed are, in the cases where that pattern doesn\u2019t apply.",

Burek (2004) also sticks to the Aristotelian classic theory of de\ufb01nition, but instead of analyzing ex- isting, natural language de\ufb01nitions, he investigates a set of ontology modeling languages to examine their ability to adopt the genus-differentia pattern and other fundamental principles, such as the essential and non-essential property differentiation, when de\ufb01ning a new ontology concept by means of axioms, that is, in a structured way rather than in natural language. He concludes that Description Logic (DL), Uni\ufb01ed Modeling Language (UML) and Object Role Modeling (ORM) present limitations to deal with some issues, and proposes a set of de\ufb01nitional tags to address those points.",

The information extraction from de\ufb01nitions has also been widely explored with the aim of constructing structured knowledge bases from machine readable dictionaries (Vossen, 1992; Calzolari, 1991; Copes- take, 1991; Vossen, 1991; Vossen and Copestake, 1994). The development of a Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) also used to take into account both semantic and syntactic information from lexical de\ufb01ni- tions, which were processed to extract the de\ufb01niendum\u2019s genus and differentiae. To populate the LKB, typed-feature structures were used to store the information from the differentiae, which were, in turn, transmitted by inheritance based on the genus information.",
            "To populate the LKB, typed-feature structures were used to store the information from the differentiae, which were, in turn, transmitted by inheritance based on the genus information. A feature structure can be seen as a set of at- tributes for a given concept, such as \u201corigin\u201d, \u201ccolor\u201d, \u201csmell\u201d, \u201ctaste\u201d and \u201ctemperature\u201d for the concept drink (or for a more general concept, such as substance, from which drink would inherit its features), for example, and the differentiae in a de\ufb01nition for a particular drink would be the values that those features assume for that drink, for example, \u201cred\u201d, \u201cwhite\u201d, \u201csweet\u201d, \u201cwarm\u201d, etc. As a result, concepts could be queried using the values of features as \ufb01lters, and words de\ufb01ned in different languages could be related, since they were represented in the same structure. To build the feature structures, restricted domains covering subsets of the vocabulary were considered, since having every relevant attribute for every possible entity de\ufb01ned beforehand is not feasible, being more overall strategies required in order to process de\ufb01nitions in large scale.",

Based on an analysis of a random sample composed by 100 WordNet noun and verb glosses, we identi\ufb01ed and named the main semantic roles and their compositions present on dictionary de\ufb01nitions. Moreover, we compared the identi\ufb01ed semantic patterns with the de\ufb01nitions\u2019 syntactic structure, pointing out the features that can serve as input for automatic role labeling. The proposed semantic roles list is by no means de\ufb01nitive or exhaustive, but a \ufb01rst step at highlighting and formalizing the most relevant aspects of widely used intensional level de\ufb01nitions.",
            "As future work, we intend to implement a rule-based classi\ufb01er, using the identi\ufb01ed syntactic patterns to generate an initial annotated dataset, which can be manually curated and subsequently feed a machine learning model able to annotate de\ufb01nitions in large scale. We expect that, through a systematic classi\ufb01- cation of their elements, lexical de\ufb01nitions can bring even more valuable information to semantic tasks that require world knowledge.
