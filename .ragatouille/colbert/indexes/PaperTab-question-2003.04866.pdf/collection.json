  "1. Introduction The lack of annotated training and evaluation data for many tasks and domains hinders the development of computational models for the majority of the world\u2019s languages (Snyder and Barzilay 2010; Adams et al. 2017; Ponti et al. 2019a). The necessity to guide and advance multilingual and cross-lingual NLP through annotation efforts that follow cross-lingually consistent guidelines has been recently recognized by collaborative initiatives such as the Universal Dependency (UD) project (Nivre et al. 2019). The latest version of UD (as of March 2020) covers more than 70 languages. Crucially, this resource continues to steadily grow and evolve through the contributions of annotators from across the world, extending the UD\u2019s reach to a wide array of typologically diverse languages. Besides steering research in multilingual parsing (Zeman et al. 2018; Kondratyuk and Straka 2019; Doitch et al. 2019) and cross-lingual parser transfer (Rasooli and Collins 2017; Lin et al.",
  "Besides steering research in multilingual parsing (Zeman et al. 2018; Kondratyuk and Straka 2019; Doitch et al. 2019) and cross-lingual parser transfer (Rasooli and Collins 2017; Lin et al. 2019; Rotman and Reichart 2019), the consistent annotations and guidelines have also enabled a range of insightful comparative studies focused on the languages\u2019 syntactic (dis)similarities (Bjerva and Augenstein 2018; Ponti et al. 2018a; Pires, Schlinger, and Garrette 2019). Inspired by the UD work and its substantial impact on research in (multilingual) syntax, in this article we introduce Multi-SimLex, a suite of manually and consistently annotated semantic datasets for 12 different languages, focused on the fundamental lexical relation of semantic similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst 2006; Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015).",
  "For any pair of words, this relation measures whether their referents share the same (functional) features, as opposed to general cognitive association captured by co-occurrence patterns in texts (i.e., the distributional information). Datasets that quantify the strength of true semantic similarity between concept pairs such as SimLex- 999 (Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015) or SimVerb-3500 (Gerz et al. 2016) have been instrumental in improving models for distributional semantics and representation learning. Discerning between semantic similarity and relatedness/association is not only crucial for theoretical studies on lexical semantics (see \u00a72), but has also been shown to bene\ufb01t a range of language understanding tasks in NLP. Examples include dialog state tracking (Mrk\u0161i\u00b4c et al. 2017; Ren et al. 2018), spoken language understanding (Kim et al. 2016; Kim, de Marneffe, and Fosler-Lussier 2016), text simpli\ufb01cation (Glava\u0161 and Vuli\u00b4c 2018; Ponti et al. 2018b; Lauscher et al.",

Despite the proven usefulness of semantic similarity datasets, they are available only for a small and typologically narrow sample of resource-rich languages such as German, Italian, and Russian (Leviant and Reichart 2015), whereas some language types and 2",
  "Vuli\u00b4c et al. Multi-SimLex low-resource languages typically lack similar evaluation data. Even if some resources do exist, they are limited in their size (e.g., 500 pairs in Turkish (Ercan and Y\u0131ld\u0131z 2018), 500 in Farsi (Camacho-Collados et al. 2017), or 300 in Finnish (Venekoski and Vankka 2017)) and coverage (e.g., all datasets which originated from the original English SimLex-999 contain only high-frequent concepts, and are dominated by nouns). This is why, as our departure point, we introduce a larger and more comprehensive English word similarity dataset spanning 1,888 concept pairs (see \u00a74). Most importantly, semantic similarity datasets in different languages have been created using heterogeneous construction procedures with different guidelines for translation and annotation, as well as different rating scales. For instance, some datasets were obtained by directly translating the English SimLex-999 in its entirety (Leviant and Reichart 2015; Mrk\u0161i\u00b4c et al. 2017) or in part (Venekoski and Vankka 2017).",
  "For instance, some datasets were obtained by directly translating the English SimLex-999 in its entirety (Leviant and Reichart 2015; Mrk\u0161i\u00b4c et al. 2017) or in part (Venekoski and Vankka 2017). Other datasets were created from scratch (Ercan and Y\u0131ld\u0131z 2018) and yet others sampled English concept pairs differently from SimLex-999 and then translated and reannotated them in target languages (Camacho-Collados et al. 2017). This heterogeneity makes these datasets incomparable and precludes systematic cross-linguistic analyses. In this article, consolidating the lessons learned from previous dataset construction paradigms, we propose a carefully designed translation and annotation protocol for developing monolingual Multi-SimLex datasets with aligned concept pairs for typologically diverse languages. We apply this protocol to a set of 12 languages, including a mixture of major languages (e.g., Mandarin, Russian, and French) as well as several low-resource ones (e.g., Kiswahili, Welsh, and Yue Chinese).",
  "We apply this protocol to a set of 12 languages, including a mixture of major languages (e.g., Mandarin, Russian, and French) as well as several low-resource ones (e.g., Kiswahili, Welsh, and Yue Chinese). We demonstrate that our proposed dataset creation procedure yields data with high inter-annotator agreement rates (e.g., the average mean inter-annotator agreement for Welsh is 0.742). The uni\ufb01ed construction protocol and alignment between concept pairs enables a series of quantitative analyses. Preliminary studies on the in\ufb02uence that polysemy and cross-lingual variation in lexical categories (see \u00a72.3) have on similarity judgments are provided in \u00a75. Data created according to Multi-SimLex protocol also allow for probing into whether similarity judgments are universal across languages, or rather depend on linguistic af\ufb01nity (in terms of linguistic features, phylogeny, and geographical location). We investigate this question in \u00a75.4.

  "We investigate this question in \u00a75.4. Naturally, Multi-SimLex datasets can be used as an intrinsic evaluation benchmark to assess the quality of lexical representations based on monolingual, joint multilingual, and transfer learning paradigms. We conduct a systematic evaluation of several state-of-the-art representation models in \u00a77, showing that there are large gaps between human and system performance in all languages. The proposed construction paradigm also supports the automatic creation of 66 cross-lingual Multi-SimLex datasets by interleaving the monolingual ones. We outline the construction of the cross-lingual datasets in \u00a76, and then present a quantitative evaluation of a series of cutting-edge cross-lingual representation models on this benchmark in \u00a78. Contributions. We now summarize the main contributions of this work: 1) Building on lessons learned from prior work, we create a more comprehensive lexical semantic similarity dataset for the English language spanning a total of 1,888 concept pairs balanced with respect to similarity, frequency, and concreteness, and covering four word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives and, for the \ufb01rst time, adverbs.",
  "This dataset serves as the main source for the creation of equivalent datasets in several other languages. 2) We present a carefully designed and rigorous language-agnostic translation and annotation protocol. These well-de\ufb01ned guidelines will facilitate the development of future Multi-SimLex datasets for other languages. The proposed protocol eliminates 3",
  "Journal Name Volume 1, Number 1 some crucial issues with prior efforts focused on the creation of multi-lingual semantic resources, namely: i) limited coverage; ii) heterogeneous annotation guidelines; and iii) concept pairs which are semantically incomparable across different languages. 3) We offer to the community manually annotated evaluation sets of 1,888 concept pairs across 12 typologically diverse languages, and 66 large cross-lingual evaluation sets. To the best of our knowledge, Multi-SimLex is the most comprehensive evaluation resource to date focused on the relation of semantic similarity. 4) We benchmark a wide array of recent state-of-the-art monolingual and cross-lingual word representation models across our sample of languages. The results can serve as strong baselines that lay the foundation for future improvements. 5) We present a \ufb01rst large-scale evaluation study on the ability of encoders pretrained on language modeling (such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) and XLM (Conneau and Lample 2019)) to reason over word-level semantic similarity in different languages.",

To our own surprise, the results show that monolingual pretrained encoders, even when presented with word types out of context, are sometimes competitive with static word embedding models such as fastText (Bojanowski et al. 2017) or word2vec (Mikolov et al. 2013). The results also reveal a huge gap in performance between massively multilingual pretrained encoders and language-speci\ufb01c encoders in favor of the latter: our \ufb01ndings support other recent empirical evidence related to the \u201ccurse of multilinguality\u201d (Conneau et al. 2019; Bapna and Firat 2019) in representation learning. 6) We make all of these resources available on a website which facilitates easy creation, submission and sharing of Multi-Simlex-style datasets for a larger number of languages.",

Moreover, we hope that it will provide means to advance our understanding of distributional and lexical semantics across a large number of languages.

  "2. Lexical Semantic Similarity 2.1 Similarity and Association The focus of the Multi-SimLex initiative is on the lexical relation of pure semantic similarity. For any pair of words, this relation measures whether their referents share the same features. For instance, graf\ufb01ti and frescos are similar to the extent that they are both forms of painting and appear on walls. This relation can be contrasted with the cognitive association between two words, which often depends on how much their referents interact in the real world, or are found in the same situations. For instance, a painter is easily associated with frescos, although they lack any physical commonalities. Association is also known in the literature under other names: relatedness (Budanitsky and Hirst 2006), topical similarity (McKeown et al. 2002), and domain similarity (Turney 2012). Semantic similarity and association overlap to some degree, but do not coincide (Kiela, Hill, and Clark 2015; Vuli\u00b4c, Kiela, and Korhonen 2017). In fact, there exist plenty of pairs that are intuitively associated but not similar.",

Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen (2015) revealed that while similarity measures based on the WordNet graph (Wu and Palmer 1994) and human judgments of association in the University of South Florida Free Association Database (Nelson, McEvoy, and Schreiber 2004) do correlate, a number of pairs follow opposite trends. Several studies on human cognition also point in the same direction. For instance, semantic priming can be triggered by similar words without association (Lucas 2000). On the other hand, a connection with cue words is established more quickly for topically related words rather than for similar words in free association tasks (De Deyne and Storms 2008). A key property of semantic similarity is its gradience: pairs of words can be similar to a different degree.",
  "On the other hand, a connection with cue words is established more quickly for topically related words rather than for similar words in free association tasks (De Deyne and Storms 2008). A key property of semantic similarity is its gradience: pairs of words can be similar to a different degree. On the other hand, the relation of synonymy is binary: pairs of words are synonyms if they can be substituted in all contexts (or most contexts, in a looser sense), otherwise they are not. While synonyms can be conceived as lying on one extreme of the semantic similarity continuum, it is crucial to note that their de\ufb01nition is stated in purely relational terms, rather than invoking their referential properties (Lyons 1977; Cruse 1986; Coseriu 1967). This makes behavioral studies on semantic similarity fundamentally different from lexical resources like WordNet (Miller 1995), which include paradigmatic relations (such as synonymy). 2.2 Similarity for NLP: Intrinsic Evaluation and Semantic Specialization The rami\ufb01cations of the distinction between similarity and association are profound for distributional semantics.",
  "2.2 Similarity for NLP: Intrinsic Evaluation and Semantic Specialization The rami\ufb01cations of the distinction between similarity and association are profound for distributional semantics. This paradigm of lexical semantics is grounded in the distributional hypothesis, formulated by Firth (1957) and Harris (1951). According to this hypothesis, the meaning of a word can be recovered empirically from the contexts in which it occurs within a collection of texts. Since both pairs of topically related words and pairs of purely similar words tend to appear in the same contexts, their associated meaning confounds the two distinct relations (Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015; Schwartz, Reichart, and Rappoport 2015; Vuli\u00b4c et al. 2017b). As a result, distributional methods obscure a crucial facet of lexical meaning. This limitation also re\ufb02ects onto word embeddings (WEs), representations of words as low-dimensional vectors that have become indispensable for a wide range of NLP applications (Collobert et al. 2011; Chen and Manning 2014; Melamud et al. 2016, inter alia).",
  "2011; Chen and Manning 2014; Melamud et al. 2016, inter alia). In particular, it involves both static WEs learned from co-occurrence patterns (Mikolov et al. 2013; Levy and Goldberg 2014; Bojanowski et al. 2017) and contextualized WEs learned from modeling word sequences (Peters et al. 2018; Devlin et al. 2019, inter alia). As a result, in the induced representations, geometrical closeness (measured e.g. through cosine distance) con\ufb02ates genuine similarity with broad relatedness. For instance, the vectors for antonyms such as sober and drunk, by de\ufb01nition dissimilar, might be neighbors in the semantic space under the distributional hypothesis. Turney (2012), Kiela and Clark (2014), and Melamud et al. (2016) demonstrated that different choices of hyper-parameters in WE algorithms (such as context window) emphasize different relations in the resulting representations. Likewise, Agirre et al.",
  "Turney (2012), Kiela and Clark (2014), and Melamud et al. (2016) demonstrated that different choices of hyper-parameters in WE algorithms (such as context window) emphasize different relations in the resulting representations. Likewise, Agirre et al. (2009) and Levy and Goldberg (2014) discovered that WEs learned from texts annotated with syntactic information mirror similarity better than simple local bag-of-words neighborhoods. The failure of WEs to capture semantic similarity, in turn, affects model performance in several NLP applications where such knowledge is crucial. In particular, Natural Language Understanding tasks such as statistical dialog modeling, text simpli\ufb01cation, or semantic text similarity (Mrk\u0161i\u00b4c et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2016; Ponti et al. 2019c), among 5",
  "Journal Name Volume 1, Number 1 others, suffer the most. As a consequence, resources providing clean information on semantic similarity are key in mitigating the side effects of the distributional signal. In particular, such databases can be employed for the intrinsic evaluations of speci\ufb01c WE models as a proxy of their reliability for downstream applications (Collobert and Weston 2008; Baroni and Lenci 2010; Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015); intuitively, the more WEs are misaligned with human judgments of similarity, the more their performance on actual tasks is expected to be degraded. Moreover, word representations can be specialized (a.k.a. retro\ufb01tted) by disentangling word relations of similarity and association. In particular, linguistic constraints sourced from external databases (such as synonyms from WordNet) can be injected into WEs (Faruqui et al. 2015; Wieting et al. 2015; Mrk\u0161i\u00b4c et al. 2017; Lauscher et al. 2019; Kamath et al.",

While the same meaning representations may be shared by all human speakers at a deep cognitive level, there is no one-to-one mapping between the words in the lexicons of different languages. This makes the comparison of similarity judgments across languages dif\ufb01cult, since the meaning overlap of translationally equivalent words is sometimes far less than exact. This results from the fact that the way languages \u2018partition\u2019 semantic \ufb01elds is partially arbitrary (Trier 1931), although constrained cross- lingually by common cognitive biases (Majid et al. 2007).",

For instance, consider the \ufb01eld of colors: English distinguishes between green and blue, whereas Murle (South Sudan) has a single word for both (Kay and Maf\ufb012013). In general, semantic typology studies the variation in lexical semantics across the world\u2019s languages. According to (Evans 2011), the ways languages categorize concepts into the lexicon follow three main axes: 1) granularity: what is the number of categories in a speci\ufb01c domain?; 2) boundary location: where do the lines marking different categories lie?; 3) grouping and dissection: what are the membership criteria of a category; which instances are considered to be more prototypical?",
  "; 2) boundary location: where do the lines marking different categories lie?; 3) grouping and dissection: what are the membership criteria of a category; which instances are considered to be more prototypical? Different choices with respect to these axes lead to different lexicalization patterns.1 For instance, distinct senses in a polysemous word in English, such as skin (referring to both the body and fruit), may be assigned separate words in other languages such as Italian pelle and buccia, respectively (Rzymski et al. 2020). We later analyze whether similarity scores obtained from native speakers also loosely follow the patterns described by semantic typology. 3. Previous Work and Evaluation Data Word Pair Datasets. Rich expert-created resources such as WordNet (Miller 1995; Fellbaum 1998), VerbNet (Kipper Schuler 2005; Kipper et al. 2008), or FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) encode a wealth of semantic and syntactic information, but are expensive and time-consuming to create. The scale of this problem gets multiplied by the number of languages in consideration.",

The scale of this problem gets multiplied by the number of languages in consideration. Therefore, crowd-sourcing with non-expert annotators has been adopted as a quicker alternative to produce smaller and more focused semantic 1 More formally, colexi\ufb01cation is a phenomenon when different meanings can be expressed by the same word in a language (Fran\u00e7ois 2008). For instance, the two senses which are distinguished in English as time and weather are co-lexi\ufb01ed in Croatian: the word vrijeme is used in both cases. 6",

This alternative practice has had a profound impact on distributional semantics and representation learning (Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015).

This inspired other similar datasets which focused on different lexical properties. For instance, SimVerb-3500 (Gerz et al. 2016) provided similarity ratings for 3,500 English verbs, whereas CARD-660 (Pilehvar et al. 2018) aimed at measuring the semantic similarity of infrequent concepts.

Semantic Similarity Datasets in Other Languages. Motivated by the impact of datasets such as SimLex-999 and SimVerb-3500 on representation learning in English, a line of related work focused on creating similar resources in other languages. The dominant approach is translating and reannotating the entire original English SimLex-999 dataset, as done previously for German, Italian, and Russian (Leviant and Reichart 2015), Hebrew and Croatian (Mrk\u0161i\u00b4c et al. 2017), and Polish (Mykowiecka, Marciniak, and Rychlik 2018).

A similar approach was followed by Ercan and Y\u0131ld\u0131z (2018) for Turkish, by Huang et al. (2019) for Mandarin Chinese, and by Sakaizawa and Komachi (2018) for Japanese.

More importantly, they also did not reannotate the translated pairs in the target languages. As we discussed in \u00a7 2.3 and reiterate later in \u00a75, semantic differences among languages can have a profound impact on the annotation scores; particulary, we show in \u00a75.4 that these differences even roughly de\ufb01ne language clusters based on language af\ufb01nity.

Further, concept pairs for different languages are sourced from different corpora (e.g., direct translation of the English data versus sampling from scratch in the target language). Moreover, the previous SimLex-based multilingual datasets inherit the main de\ufb01ciencies of the English original version, such as the focus on nouns and highly frequent concepts. Finally, prior work mostly focused on languages that are widely spoken and do not account for the variety of the world\u2019s languages.

  "Journal Name Volume 1, Number 1 lingual natural language inference. XNLI was created by translating examples from the English MultiNLI dataset, and projecting its sentence labels (Williams, Nangia, and Bowman 2018). Other recent multilingual datasets target the task of question answering based on reading comprehension: i) MLQA (Lewis et al. 2019) includes 7 languages ii) XQuAD (Artetxe, Ruder, and Yogatama 2019) 10 languages; iii) TyDiQA (Clark et al. 2020) 9 widely spoken typologically diverse languages. While MLQA and XQuAD result from the translation from an English dataset, TyDiQA was built independently in each language. Another multilingual dataset, PAWS-X (Yang et al. 2019), focused on the paraphrase identi\ufb01cation task and was created translating the original English PAWS (Zhang, Baldridge, and He 2019) into 6 languages.

  "We believe that Multi-SimLex can substantially contribute to this endeavor by offering a comprehensive multilingual benchmark for the fundamental lexical level relation of semantic similarity. In future work, Multi-SimLex also offers an opportunity to investigate the correlations between word-level semantic similarity and performance in downstream tasks such as QA and NLI across different languages. 4. The Base for Multi-SimLex: Extending English SimLex-999 In this section, we discuss the design principles behind the English (ENG) Multi-SimLex dataset, which is the basis for all the Multi-SimLex datasets in other languages, as detailed in \u00a75. We \ufb01rst argue that a new, more balanced, and more comprehensive evaluation resource for lexical semantic similarity in English is necessary. We then describe how the 1,888 word pairs contained in the ENG Multi-SimLex were selected in such a way as to represent various linguistic phenomena within a single integrated resource.

The following criteria have to be satis\ufb01ed by any high-quality semantic evaluation resource, as argued by previous studies focused on the creation of such resources (Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015; Gerz et al.",

The resource must cover the full range of diverse concepts occurring in natural language, including different word classes (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs), concrete and abstract concepts, a variety of lexical \ufb01elds, and different frequency ranges. (C2) Clearly de\ufb01ned. The resource must provide a clear understanding of which semantic relation exactly is annotated and measured, possibly contrasting it with other relations. For instance, the original SimLex-999 and SimVerb-3500 explicitly focus on true semantic similarity and distinguish it from broader relatedness captured by datasets such as MEN (Bruni, Tran, and Baroni 2014) or WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al. 2002).",

(C3) Consistent and reliable. The resource must ensure consistent annotations obtained from non-expert native speakers following simple and precise annotation guidelines. In choosing the word pairs and constructing ENG Multi-SimLex, we adhere to these requirements. Moreover, we follow good practices established by the research on related resources. In particular, since the introduction of the original SimLex-999 dataset (Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015), follow-up works have improved its construction protocol across several aspects, including: 1) coverage of more lexical \ufb01elds, e.g., by relying on a diverse set of Wikipedia categories (Camacho-Collados et al. 2017), 2) infrequent/rare words (Pilehvar et al. 2018), 3) focus on particular word classes, e.g., verbs (Gerz et al.",

The Final Output: English Multi-SimLex. In order to ensure that the criterion C1 is satis\ufb01ed, we consolidate and integrate the data already carefully sampled in prior work into a single, comprehensive, and representative dataset. This way, we can control for diversity, frequency, and other properties while avoiding to perform this time-consuming selection process from scratch. Note that, on the other hand, the word pairs chosen for English are scored from scratch as part of the entire Multi-SimLex annotation process, introduced later in \u00a75. We now describe the external data sources for the \ufb01nal set of word pairs: 1) Source: SimLex-999. (Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015).

We randomly sample 244 verb pairs from SimVerb-3500 that represent all similarity spectra. In particular, we add 61 verb pairs for each of the similarity intervals: [0, 1.5), [1.5, 3), [3, 4.5), [4.5, 6].

  "As a consequence, Multi-SimLex allows for \ufb01ne-grained analyses over different POS classes, concreteness levels, similarity spectra, frequency intervals, relation types, morphology, lexical \ufb01elds, and it also includes some challenging orthographically similar examples (e.g., infection \u2013 in\ufb02ection).3 We ensure that the criteria C2 and C3 are satis\ufb01ed by using similar annotation guidelines as Simlex-999, SimVerb-3500, and SEMEVAL-500 that explicitly target semantic similarity.

(1) All pairs in the translated set must be unique (i.e., no duplicate pairs); (2) Translating two words from the same English pair into the same word in the target language is not allowed (e.g., it is not allowed to translate car and automobile to the same Spanish word coche). (3) The translated pairs must preserve the semantic relations between the two words when possible. This means that, when multiple translations are possible, the translation that best conveys the semantic relation between the two words found in the original English pair is selected. (4) If it is not possible to use a single-word translation in the target language, then a multi-word expression (MWE) can be used to convey the nearest possible semantics given the above points (e.g., the English word homework is translated into the Polish MWE praca domowa).",
  "(4) If it is not possible to use a single-word translation in the target language, then a multi-word expression (MWE) can be used to convey the nearest possible semantics given the above points (e.g., the English word homework is translated into the Polish MWE praca domowa). Satisfying the above rules when \ufb01nding appropriate translations for each pair\u2013while keeping to the spirit of the intended semantic relation in the English version\u2013is not always straightforward. For instance, kinship terminology in Sinitic languages (Mandarin and Yue) uses different terms depending on whether the family member is older or younger, and whether the family member comes from the mother\u2019s side or the father\u2019s side. In Mandarin, brother has no direct translation and can be translated as either: \u54e5\u54e5(older brother) or \u5f1f\u5f1f(younger brother). Therefore, in such cases, the translators are asked to choose the best option given the semantic context (relation) expressed by the pair in English, otherwise select one of the translations arbitrarily. This is also used to remove duplicate pairs in the translated set, by differentiating the duplicates using a variant at each instance.",

This is also used to remove duplicate pairs in the translated set, by differentiating the duplicates using a variant at each instance. Further, many translation instances were resolved using near-synonymous terms in the translation. For example, the words in the pair: wood \u2013 timber can only be directly translated in Estonian to puit, and are not distinguishable. Therefore, the translators approximated the translation for timber to the compound noun puitmaterjal (literally: wood material) in order to produce a valid pair in the target language. In some cases, a direct transliteration from English is used. For example, the pair: physician and 11",

Across all languages, the average score (mean = 1.61, median= 1.1) is on the lower side of the similarity scale. However, looking closer at the scores of each language in Table 6, we indicate notable differences in both the averages and the spread of scores.

  "Notably, French has the highest average of similarity scores (mean= 2.61, median= 2.5), while Kiswahili has the lowest average (mean= 1.28, median= 0.5). Russian has the lowest spread (\u03c3 = 1.37), while Polish has the largest (\u03c3 = 1.62). All of the languages are strongly correlated with each other, as shown in Figure 1, where all of the Spearman\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cients are greater than 0.6 for all language pairs. Languages that share the same language family are highly correlated (e.g, CMN-YUE, RUS-POL, EST-FIN). In addition, we observe high correlations between English and most other languages, as expected. This is due to the effect of using English as the base/anchor language to create the dataset. In simple words, if one translates to two languages L1 and L2 starting from the same set of pairs in English, it is higly likely that L1 and L2 will diverge from English in different ways.",
  "In simple words, if one translates to two languages L1 and L2 starting from the same set of pairs in English, it is higly likely that L1 and L2 will diverge from English in different ways. Therefore, the similarity between L1-ENG and L2-ENG is expected to be higher than between L1-L2, especially if L1 and L2 are typologically dissimilar languages (e.g., HEB-CMN, see Figure 1). This phenomenon is well documented in related prior work (Leviant and Reichart 2015; Camacho-Collados et al. 2017; Mrk\u0161i\u00b4c et al. 2017; Vuli\u00b4c, Ponzetto, and Glava\u0161 2019).

  "There can be several explanations for the differences in similarity scores across languages, including but not limited to cultural context, polysemy, metonymy, translation, regional and generational differences, and most commonly, the fact that words and meanings do not exactly map onto each other across languages. For example, it is likely that the other three languages do not have two separate words for describing the concepts in the concept pair: big \u2013 large, and the translators had to opt for similar lexical items that were more distant in meaning, explaining why in English the concept pair received a much higher average similarity score than in other languages. A similar issue related to the mapping problem across languages arose in the Welsh concept pair yn llwye \u2013 yn gyfan gwbl, where Welsh speakers agreed that the two concepts are very similar. When asked, bilingual speakers considered the two Welsh concepts more similar than English equivalents purely \u2013 completely, potentially explaining why a higher average similarity score was reached in Welsh. The example of woman \u2013 wife can illustrate cultural differences or another translation-related issue where the word \u2018wife\u2019 did not exist in some languages (for example, Estonian), and therefore had to be described using other words, affecting the comparability of the similarity scores.",

This was also the case with the football \u2013 soccer concept pair. The pair bank \u2013 seat demonstrates the effect of the polysemy mismatch across languages: while \u2018bank\u2019 has two different meanings in English, neither of them is similar to the word \u2018seat\u2019, but in Spanish, \u2018banco\u2019 can mean \u2018bank\u2019, but it can also mean \u2018bench\u2019. Quite naturally, Spanish speakers gave the pair banco \u2013 asiento a higher similarity score than the speakers of languages where this polysemy did not occur. An example of metonymy affecting the average similarity score can be seen in the Kiswahili version of the word pair: sunset \u2013 evening (machweo \u2013 jioni). The average similarity score for this pair is much higher in Kiswahili, likely because the word \u2018sunset\u2019 can act as a metonym of \u2018evening\u2019.",
  "The average similarity score for this pair is much higher in Kiswahili, likely because the word \u2018sunset\u2019 can act as a metonym of \u2018evening\u2019. The low similarity score of wonderful \u2013 terri\ufb01c in Kiswahili (wa ajabu - mkubwa sana) can be explained by the fact that while \u2018mkubwa sana\u2019 can be used as \u2018terri\ufb01c\u2019 in Kiswahili, it technically means \u2018very big\u2019, adding to the examples of translation- and mapping-related effects. The word pair amazingly \u2013 fantastically (espantosamente \u2013 fant\u00e1sticamente) brings out another translation-related problem: the accuracy of the translation. While \u2018espantosamente\u2019 could arguably be translated to \u2018amazingly\u2019, more common meanings include: \u2018frightfully\u2019, \u2018terrifyingly\u2019, and \u2018shockingly\u2019, explaining why the average similarity score differs from the rest of the languages.

  "5.4 Effect of Language Af\ufb01nity on Similarity Scores Based on the analysis in Figure 1 and inspecting the anecdotal examples in the previous section, it is evident that the correlation between similarity scores across languages is not random. To corroborate this intuition, we visualize the vectors of similarity scores for each single language by reducing their dimensionality to 2 via Principal Component Analysis (Pearson 1901). The resulting scatter plot in Figure 3 reveals that languages from the same family or branch have similar patterns in the scores. In particular, Russian and Polish (both Slavic), Finnish and Estonian (both Uralic), Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese (both Sinitic), and Spanish and French (both Romance) are all neighbors. In order to quantify exactly the effect of language af\ufb01nity on the similarity scores, we run correlation analyses between these and language features. In particular, we extract feature vectors from URIEL (Littell et al. 2017), a massively multilingual typological database that collects and normalizes information compiled by grammarians and \ufb01eld linguists about the world\u2019s languages.",

Hence, we \ufb01rst construct a distance matrix for each vector space, such that both columns and rows are language indices, and each cell value is the cosine distance between the vectors of the corresponding language pair.

To estimate the correlation between the matrix for similarity judgments and each of the matrices for linguistic features, we run a Mantel test (Mantel 1967), a non-parametric statistical test based on matrix permutations that takes into account inter-dependencies among pairwise distances. The results of the Mantel test reported in Table 3 show that there exist statistically signi\ufb01cant correlations between similarity judgments and geography, family, and syntax, given that p < 0.05 and z > 1.96. The correlation coef\ufb01cient is particularly strong for geography (r = 0.647) and syntax (r = 0.649). The former result is intuitive, because languages in contact easily borrow and loan lexical units, and cultural interactions may result in similar cognitive categorizations. The result for syntax, instead, cannot be explained so easily, as formal properties of language do not affect lexical semantics. Instead, we conjecture that, while no causal relation is present, both syntactic features and similarity judgments might be linked to a common explanatory variable (such as geography).",

Cross-Lingual Multi-SimLex Datasets A crucial advantage of having semantically aligned monolingual datasets across dif- ferent languages is the potential to create cross-lingual semantic similarity datasets. Such datasets allow for probing the quality of cross-lingual representation learning algorithms (Camacho-Collados et al. 2017; Conneau et al. 2018a; Chen and Cardie 2018; Doval et al. 2018; Ruder, Vuli\u00b4c, and S\u00f8gaard 2019; Conneau and Lample 2019; Ruder, S\u00f8gaard, and Vuli\u00b4c 2019) as an intrinsic evaluation task. However, the cross-lingual datasets previous work relied upon (Camacho-Collados et al.",
  "However, the cross-lingual datasets previous work relied upon (Camacho-Collados et al. 2017) were limited to a homogeneous set of high-resource languages (e.g., English, German, Italian, Spanish) and a small number of concept pairs (all less than 1K pairs). We address both problems by 1) using a typologically more diverse language sample, and 2) relying on a substantially larger English dataset as a source for the cross-lingual datasets: 1,888 pairs in this work versus 500 pairs in the work of Camacho-Collados et al. (2017). As a result, each of our cross-lingual datasets contains a substantially larger number of concept pairs, as shown in Table 11. The cross-lingual Multi-Simlex datasets are constructed automatically, leveraging word pair translations and annotations collected in all 12 languages. This yields a total of 66 cross-lingual datasets, one for each possible combination of languages.",

  "Score and Class Distributions. The summary of score and class distributions across all 66 cross-lingual datasets are provided in Figure 4a and Figure 4b, respectively. First, it is obvious that the distribution over the four POS classes largely adheres to that of the original monolingual Multi-SimLex datasets, and that the variance is quite low: e.g., the ENG-FRA dataset contains the lowest proportion of nouns (49.21%) and the highest proportion of verbs (27.1%), adjectives (15.28%), and adverbs (8.41%). On the other hand, the distribution over similarity intervals in Figure 4a shows a much greater variance. This is again expected as this pattern resurfaces in monolingual datasets (see Table 6). It is also evident that the data are skewed towards lower-similarity concept pairs. However, due to the joint size of all cross-lingual datasets (see Table 11), even the least represented 21",

Monolingual Evaluation of Representation Learning Models After the numerical and qualitative analyses of the Multi-SimLex datasets provided in \u00a7\u00a7 5.3\u20135.4, we now benchmark a series of representation learning models on the new evaluation data.

These experiments provide strong baseline scores on the new Multi-SimLex datasets and offer a \ufb01rst large- scale analysis of pretrained encoders on word-level semantic similarity across diverse languages. In addition, the experiments now enabled by Multi-SimLex aim to answer several important questions. (Q1) Is it viable to extract high-quality word-level repre- sentations from pretrained encoders receiving subword-level tokens as input? Are such representations competitive with standard static word-level embeddings? (Q2) What are the implications of monolingual pretraining versus (massively) multilingual pretraining for performance? (Q3) Do lightweight unsupervised post-processing techniques improve word representations consistently across different languages? (Q4) Can we effectively transfer available external lexical knowledge from resource-rich languages to resource- lean languages in order to learn word representations that distinguish between true similarity and conceptual relatedness (see the discussion in \u00a72.3)? 7.1 Models in Comparison Static Word Embeddings in Different Languages.

In fact, FASTTEXT is an extension of the standard word-level CBOW and skip-gram word2vec models (Mikolov et al. 2013) that takes into account subword- level information, i.e. the contituent character n-grams of each word (Zhu, Vuli\u00b4c, and Korhonen 2019). For this reason, FASTTEXT is also more suited for modeling rare words and morphologically rich languages.6 We rely on 300-dimensional FT word vectors trained on CC+Wiki and available online for 157 languages.7 The word vectors for all languages are obtained by CBOW with position-weights, with character n-grams of length 5, a window of size 5, 10 negative examples, and 10 training epochs.",

Following prior work, we trim the vocabularies for all languages to the 200K most frequent words and compute representations for multi-word expressions by averaging the vectors of their constituent words. Unsupervised Post-Processing. Further, we consider a variety of unsupervised post-processing steps that can be applied post-training on top of any pretrained input word embedding space without any external lexical semantic resource. So far, the usefulness of such methods has been veri\ufb01ed only on the English language through benchmarks for lexical semantics and sentence-level tasks (Mu, Bhat, and Viswanath 2018). In this paper, we assess if unsupervised post-processing is bene\ufb01cial also in other languages.",
  "In this paper, we assess if unsupervised post-processing is bene\ufb01cial also in other languages. To this end, we apply the following post-hoc transformations on the initial word embeddings: 1) Mean centering (MC) is applied after unit length normalization to ensure that all vectors have a zero mean, and is commonly applied in data mining and analysis (Bro and Smilde 2003; van den Berg et al. 2006). 2) All-but-the-top (ABTT) (Mu, Bhat, and Viswanath 2018; Tang, Mousavi, and de Sa 2019) eliminates the common mean vector and a few top dominating directions (according to PCA) from the input distributional word vectors, since they do not contribute towards distinguishing the actual semantic meaning of different words. The method contains a single (tunable) hyper-parameter ddA which denotes the number of the dominating directions to remove from the initial representations.",
  "The method contains a single (tunable) hyper-parameter ddA which denotes the number of the dominating directions to remove from the initial representations.

For more technical details we refer the reader to the original work of Artetxe et al. (2018).

When using UNCOVEC and ABTT we always length-normalize and mean-center the data \ufb01rst (i.e., we apply the simple MC normalization). Finally, we tune the two hyper-parameters dA (for ABTT) and \u03b1 (UNCOVEC) on the English Multi-SimLex and use the same values on the datasets of all other languages; we report results with ddA = 3 or ddA = 10, and \u03b1 = \u22120.3.

  "Impact of Unsupervised Post-Processing. First, the results in Table 12 suggest that applying dimension-wise mean centering to the initial vector spaces has positive impact on word similarity scores in all test languages and for all models, both static and contextualized (see the +MC rows in Table 12). Mimno and Thompson (2017) show that distributional word vectors have a tendency towards narrow clusters in the vector space (i.e., they occupy a narrow cone in the vector space and are therefore anisotropic (Mu, Bhat, and Viswanath 2018; Ethayarajh 2019)), and are prone to the undesired effect of hubness (Radovanovi\u00b4c, Nanopoulos, and Ivanovi\u00b4c 2010; Lazaridou, Dinu, and Baroni 2015).15 Applying dimension-wise mean centering has the effect of spreading the vectors across the hyper-plane and mitigating the hubness issue, which consequently improves word- level similarity, as it emerges from the reported results.

In sum, as a general rule of thumb, we suggest to always mean-center representations for semantic tasks. The results further indicate that additional post-processing methods such as ABTT and UNCOVEC on top of mean-centered vector spaces can lead to further gains in most languages. The gains are even visible for languages which start from high correlation scores: for instance., CMN with CC+Wiki FT increases from 0.534 to 0.583, from 0.315 to 0.526 with Wiki FT, and from 0.408 to 0.487 with M-BERT. Similarly, for RUS with CC+Wiki FT we can improve from 0.422 to 0.500, and for FRA the scores improve from 0.578 to 0.613. There are additional similar cases reported in Table 12.

Overall, the unsupervised post-processing techniques seem universally useful across languages, but their ef\ufb01cacy and relative performance does vary across different languages. Note that we have not carefully \ufb01ne-tuned the hyper-parameters of the evaluated post-processing methods, so additional small improvements can be expected for some languages. The main \ufb01nding, however, is that these post-processing techniques are robust to semantic similarity computations beyond English, and are truly language independent. For instance, removing dominant latent (PCA-based) components from word vectors emphasizes semantic differences between different concepts, as only shared non-informative latent semantic knowledge is removed from the representations. In summary, pretrained word embeddings do contain more information pertaining to semantic similarity than revealed in the initial vectors. This way, we have corroborated the hypotheses from prior work (Mu, Bhat, and Viswanath 2018; Artetxe et al. 2018) which were not previously empirically veri\ufb01ed on other languages due to a shortage of evaluation data; this gap has now been \ufb01lled with the introduction of the Multi-SimLex datasets.",

We present the results for subsets of word pairs grouped by POS class in Table 13. Prior work based on English data showed that representations for nouns are typically of higher quality than those for the other POS classes (Schwartz, Reichart, and Rappoport 2015, 2016; Vuli\u00b4c et al. 2017b). We observe a similar trend in other languages as well. This pattern is consistent across different representation models and can be attributed to several reasons. First, verb representations need to express a rich range of syntactic and semantic behaviors rather than purely referential features (Gruber 1976; Levin 1993; Kipper et al. 2008).",

First, verb representations need to express a rich range of syntactic and semantic behaviors rather than purely referential features (Gruber 1976; Levin 1993; Kipper et al. 2008). Second, low correlation scores on the adjective and adverb subsets in some languages (e.g., POL, CYM, SWA) might be due to their low frequency in monolingual texts, which yields unreliable representations. In general, the variance in performance across different word classes warrants further research in class- speci\ufb01c representation learning (Baker, Reichart, and Korhonen 2014; Vuli\u00b4c et al. 2017b). The scores further attest the usefulness of unsupervised post-processing as almost all class-speci\ufb01c correlation scores are improved by applying mean-centering and ABTT.

Naturally, the results from Tables 12 and 13 also reveal that there is variation in performance of both static word embeddings and pretrained encoders across different languages. Among other causes, the lowest absolute scores with FT are reported for languages with least resources available to train monolingual word embeddings, such as Kiswahili, Welsh, and Estonian. The low performance on Welsh is especially indicative: Figure 1 shows that the ratings in the Welsh dataset match up very 28",
  "Vuli\u00b4c et al. Multi-SimLex well with the English ratings, but we cannot achieve the same level of correlation in Welsh with Welsh FT word embeddings. Difference in performance between two closely related languages, EST (low-resource) and FIN (high-resource), provides additional evidence in this respect. The highest reported scores with M-BERT and XLM-100 are obtained for Mandarin Chinese and Yue Chinese: this effectively points to the weaknesses of massively multilin- gual training with a joint subword vocabulary spanning 102 and 100 languages. Due to the difference in scripts, \u201clanguage-speci\ufb01c\u201d subwords for YUE and CMN do not need to be shared across a vast amount of languages and the quality of their representation remains unscathed.

We also observe lower absolute scores (and a larger number of OOVs) for languages with very rich and productive morphological systems such as the two Slavic languages (Polish and Russian) and Finnish. Since Polish and Russian are known to have large Wikipedias and Common Crawl data (Conneau et al. 2019) (e.g., their Wikipedias are in the top 10 largest Wikipedias worldwide), the problem with coverage can be attributed exactly to the proliferation of morphological forms in those languages.

(2019c).18 In a nutshell, their LI-POSTSPEC method is a multi-step procedure that operates as follows. First, the knowledge about semantic similarity is extracted from WordNet in the form of triplets, that is, linguistic constraints (w1, w2, r), where w1 and w2 are two concepts, and r is a relation between them obtained from WordNet (e.g., synonymy or antonymy). The goal is to \u201cattract\u201d synonyms closer to each other in the transformed vector space as they re\ufb02ect true semantic similarity, and \u201crepel\u201d antonyms further apart. In the second step, the linguistic constraints are translated from English to the target language via a shared cross-lingual word vector space. To this end, following Ponti et al.",
  "In the second step, the linguistic constraints are translated from English to the target language via a shared cross-lingual word vector space. To this end, following Ponti et al. (2019c) we rely on cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs) (Joulin et al. 2018) available online, which are based on Wiki FT vectors.19 Following that, a constraint re\ufb01nement step is applied in the target language which aims to eliminate the noise inserted during the translation process. This is done by training a relation classi\ufb01cation tool: it is trained again on the English linguistic constraints and then used on the translated target language constraints, where the transfer is again enabled via a shared cross-lingual word vector space.20 Finally, a state-of-the-art monolingual specialization procedure from Ponti et al. (2018b) injects the (now target language) linguistic constraints into the target language distributional space. The scores are summarized in Table 14. Semantic specialization with LI-POSTSPEC leads to substantial improvements in correlation scores for the majority of the target languages, demonstrating the importance of external semantic similarity knowledge for semantic similarity reasoning.",
  "The scores are summarized in Table 14. Semantic specialization with LI-POSTSPEC leads to substantial improvements in correlation scores for the majority of the target languages, demonstrating the importance of external semantic similarity knowledge for semantic similarity reasoning. However, we also observe deteriorated performance for the three target languages which can be considered the lowest-resource ones in our set: CYM, SWA, YUE. We hypothesize that this occurs due to the inferior quality of the underlying monolingual Wikipedia word embeddings, which generates a chain of error accumulations. In particular, poor distributional word estimates compromise the alignment of the embedding spaces, which in turn results in increased translation noise, and reduced re\ufb01nement ability of the relation classi\ufb01er. On a high level, this \u201cpoor get poorer\u201d observation again points to the fact that one of the primary causes of low performance of resource-low languages in semantic tasks is the sheer lack of even unlabeled data for distributional training. On the other hand, as we see from Table 13, typological dissimilarity between the source and the target does not deteriorate the effectiveness of semantic specialization.",
  "On the other hand, as we see from Table 13, typological dissimilarity between the source and the target does not deteriorate the effectiveness of semantic specialization. In fact, LI-POSTSPEC does yield substantial gains also for the typologically distant targets such as HEB, CMN, and EST. The critical problem indeed seems to be insuf\ufb01cient raw data for monolingual distributional training. 8. Cross-Lingual Evaluation Similar to monolingual evaluation in \u00a77, we now evaluate several state-of-the-art cross- lingual representation models on the suite of 66 automatically constructed cross-lingual Multi-SimLex datasets. Again, note that evaluating a full range of cross-lingual models 18 We have also evaluated other specialization transfer methods, e.g., (Glava\u0161 and Vuli\u00b4c 2018; Ponti et al. 2018b), but they are consistently outperformed by the method of Ponti et al.

We therefore focus our cross-lingual analyses on several well- established and indicative state-of-the-art cross-lingual models, again spanning both static and contextualized cross-lingual word embeddings. 8.1 Models in Comparison Static Word Embeddings. We rely on a state-of-the-art mapping-based method for the induction of cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs): VECMAP (Artetxe, Labaka, and Agirre 2018b). The core idea behind such mapping-based or projection-based approaches is to learn a post-hoc alignment of independently trained monolingual word embeddings (Ruder, Vuli\u00b4c, and S\u00f8gaard 2019). Such methods have gained popularity due to their conceptual simplicity and competitive performance coupled with reduced bilingual supervision requirements: they support CLWE induction with only as much as a few thousand word translation pairs as the bilingual supervision (Mikolov, Le, and Sutskever 2013; Xing et al. 2015; Upadhyay et al.",
  "2015; Upadhyay et al. 2016; Ruder, S\u00f8gaard, and Vuli\u00b4c 2019). More recent work has shown that CLWEs can be induced with even weaker supervision from small dictionaries spanning several hundred pairs (Vuli\u00b4c and Korhonen 2016; Vuli\u00b4c et al. 2019), identical strings (Smith et al. 2017), or even only shared numerals (Artetxe, Labaka, and Agirre 2017). In the extreme, fully unsupervised projection-based CLWEs extract such seed bilingual lexicons from scratch on the basis of monolingual data only (Conneau et al. 2018a; Artetxe, Labaka, and Agirre 2018b; Hoshen and Wolf 2018; Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola 2018; Chen and Cardie 2018; Mohiuddin and Joty 2019, inter alia).

Therefore, we focus on 1) its fully unsupervised variant (UNSUPER) in our comparisons. For several language pairs, we also report scores with two other VECMAP model variants: 2) a supervised variant which learns a mapping based on an available seed lexicon (SUPER), and 3) a supervised variant with self-learning (SUPER+SL) which iteratively increases the seed lexicon and improves the mapping gradually. For a detailed description of these variants, we refer the reader to recent work (Artetxe, Labaka, and Agirre 2018b; Vuli\u00b4c et al. 2019).

First, we observe that the fully unsupervised VECMAP model, despite being the most robust fully unsupervised method at present, fails to produce a meaningful cross- lingual word vector space for a large number of language pairs (see the bottom triangle 21 https://github.com/cambridgeltl/panlex-bli 33",

The scores are particularly low across the board for lower-resource languages such as Welsh and Kiswahili. It also seems that the lack of monolingual data is a larger problem than typological dissimilarity between language pairs, as we do observe reasonably high correlation scores with VECMAP for language pairs such as CMN-SPA, HEB-EST, and RUS-FIN.",

Similar to prior work of Vuli\u00b4c et al. (2019) and Doval et al. (2019), given the fact that unsupervised VECMAP is the most robust unsupervised CLWE method at present (Glava\u0161 et al. 2019), our results again question the usefulness of fully unsupervised approaches for a large number of languages, and call for further developments in the area of unsupervised and weakly supervised cross-lingual representation learning.

  "The scores of M-BERT and XLM-10022 lead to similar conclusions as in the mono- lingual settings. Reasonable correlation scores are achieved only for a small subset of resource-rich language pairs (e.g., ENG, FRA, SPA, CMN) which dominate the multilingual M-BERT training. Interestingly, the scores indicate a much higher performance of language pairs where YUE is one of the languages when we use M-BERT instead of VECMAP. This boils down again to the fact that YUE, due to its speci\ufb01c language script, has a good representation of its words and subwords in the shared M-BERT vocabulary. At the same time, a reliable VECMAP mapping between YUE and other languages cannot be found due to a small monolingual YUE corpus. In cases when VECMAP does not yield a degenerate 22 The XLM-100 scores are not reported for brevity; they largely follow the patterns observed with M-BERT.

Finally, the results in Figure 6a again verify the usefulness of unsupervised post- processing also in cross-lingual settings. We observe improved performance with both M-BERT and XLM-100 when mean centering (+MC) is applied, and further gains can be achieved by using ABTT on the mean-centered vector spaces.

Therefore, we examine 1) if we can further improve the results on cross-lingual Multi-SimLex resorting to (at least some) cross-lingual supervision for resource-rich language pairs; and 2) if such available word-level supervision can also be useful for a range of languages which displayed near-zero performance in Table 15.

The importance of self-learning increases with decreasing available seed dictionary size, and the +SL model always outperforms UNSUPER with 1k seed pairs; we observe the same patterns also with even smaller dictionary sizes than reported in Table 16 (250 and 500 seed pairs).

Conclusion and Future Work We have presented Multi-SimLex, a resource containing human judgments on the semantic similarity of word pairs for 12 monolingual and 66 cross-lingual datasets. The languages covered are typologically diverse and include also under-resourced ones, such as Welsh and Kiswahili. The resource covers an unprecedented amount of 1,888 word pairs, carefully balanced according to their similarity score, frequency, concreteness, part-of-speech class, and lexical \ufb01eld. In addition to Multi-Simlex, we release the detailed protocol we followed to create this resource. We hope that our consistent guidelines will encourage researchers to translate and annotate Multi-Simlex -style datasets for 36",

The core Multi-SimLex we release with this paper already enables researchers to carry out novel linguistic analysis as well as establishes a benchmark for evaluating representation learning models. Based on our preliminary analyses, we found that speakers of closely related languages tend to express equivalent similarity judgments. In particular, geographical proximity seems to play a greater role than family membership in determining the similarity of judgments across languages.

In addition, our results provide several important insights for research on both monolingual and cross-lingual word representations: 1) Unsupervised post-processing techniques (mean centering, elimination of top principal components, adjusting similarity orders) are always bene\ufb01cial independently of the language, although the combination leading to the best scores is language-speci\ufb01c and hence needs to be tuned. 2) Similarity rankings obtained from word embeddings for nouns are better aligned with human judgments than all the other part-of-speech classes considered here (verbs, adjectives, and, for the \ufb01rst time, adverbs). This con\ufb01rms previous generalizations based on experiments on English. 3) The factor having the greatest impact on the quality of word representations is the availability of raw texts to train them in the \ufb01rst place, rather than language properties (such as family, geographical area, typological features).",

Future work can expand our preliminary, yet large-scale study on the ability of pretrained encoders to reason over word-level semantic similarity in different languages. For instance, we have highlighted how sharing the same encoder parameters across multiple languages may harm performance. However, it remains unclear if, and to what extent, the input language embeddings present in XLM-100 but absent in M-BERT help mitigate this issue. In addition, pretrained language embeddings can be obtained both from typological databases (Littell et al. 2017) and from neural architectures (Malaviya, Neubig, and Littell 2017). Plugging these embeddings into the encoders in lieu of embeddings trained end-to-end as suggested by prior work (Tsvetkov et al. 2016; Ammar et al. 2016; Ponti et al. 2019b) might extend the coverage to more resource-lean languages.",

  "Journal Name Volume 1, Number 1 semantic similarity and sentence-level Natural Language Understanding. In particular, Multi-SimLex \ufb01lls a gap in available resources for multilingual NLP and might help understand how lexical and compositional semantics interact if put alongside existing resources such as XNLI (Conneau et al. 2018b) for natural language inference or PAWS-X (Yang et al. 2019) for cross-lingual paraphrase identi\ufb01cation. Finally, the Multi-SimLex annotation could turn out to be a unique source of evidence to study the effects of polysemy in human judgments on semantic similarity: for equivalent word pairs in multiple languages, are the similarity scores affected by how many senses the two words (or multi-word expressions) incorporate? In light of the success of initiatives like Universal Dependencies for multilingual treebanks, we hope that making Multi-SimLex and its guidelines available will encourage other researchers to expand our current sample of languages. We particularly encourage creation and submission of comparable Multi-SimLex datasets for under-resourced and typologically diverse languages in future work.",
