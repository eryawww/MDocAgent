      "arXiv:1909.01247v2  [cs.CL]  27 Apr 2020 Introducing RONEC - the Romanian Named Entity Corpus Stefan Daniel Dumitrescu, Andrei-Marius Avram1 University Politehnica of Bucharest1 Bucharest, Romania dumitrescu.stefan@gmail.com, avram.andreimarius@gmail.com Abstract We present RONEC - the Named Entity Corpus for the Romanian language. The corpus contains over 26000 entities in 5000 annotated sentences, belonging to 16 distinct classes. The sentences have been extracted from a copy-right free newspaper, covering several styles. This corpus represents the \ufb01rst initiative in the Romanian language space speci\ufb01cally targeted for named entity recognition. It is available as BRAT and CoNLL-U Plus (in Multi-Word Expression and IOB formats) text downloads, and it is free to use and extend at github.com/dumitrescustefan/ronec .

      "Keywords: Named Entity Corpus, NER, Romanian, CoNLL-U Plus format, BRAT, open-source 1. Introduction Language resources are an essential component in entire R&D domains. From the humble but vast repositories of monolingual texts that are used by the newest language modeling approaches like BERT1 and GPT2, to parallel cor- pora that allows our machine translation systems to inch closer to human performance, to the more specialized re- sources like WordNets3 that encode semantic relations be- tween nodes, these resources are necessary for the general advancement of Natural Language Processing, which even- tually evolves into real apps and services we are (already) taking for granted. We introduce RONEC - the ROmanian Named Entity Corpus4, a free, open-source resource that contains anno- tated named entities in copy-right free text. A named entity corpus is generally used for Named En- tity Recognition (NER): the identi\ufb01cation of entities in text such as names of persons, locations, companies, dates, quantities, monetary values, etc.",
      "A named entity corpus is generally used for Named En- tity Recognition (NER): the identi\ufb01cation of entities in text such as names of persons, locations, companies, dates, quantities, monetary values, etc. This information would be very useful for any number of applications: from a general information extraction system down to task-speci\ufb01c apps such as identifying monetary values in invoices or product and company references in customer reviews. We motivate the need for this corpus primarily because, for Romanian, there is no other such corpus. This basic neces- sity has sharply arisen as we, while working on a different project, have found out there are no usable resources to help us in an Information Extraction task: we were unable to extract people, locations or dates/values. This constituted a major road-block, with the only solution being to create such a corpus ourselves. As the corpus was out-of-scope for this project, the work was done privately, outside the umbrella of any authors\u2019 af\ufb01liations - this is why we are 1BERT, released in 2018, is the baseline for today\u2019s much more advanced systems.",
      "As the corpus was out-of-scope for this project, the work was done privately, outside the umbrella of any authors\u2019 af\ufb01liations - this is why we are 1BERT, released in 2018, is the baseline for today\u2019s much more advanced systems. 2OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) is a very strong text generation model. 3RoWordNet (Dumitrescu et al., 2018) is a relatively recent re- source in the Romanian language space. 4RONEC ISLRN: 723-333-596-623-8, available at https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/ronec able to distribute this corpus completely free5. The current landscape in Romania regarding language re- sources is relatively unchanged from the outline given by the META-NET6 project over six years ago. The in-depth analysis performed in this European-wide Horizon2020- funded project revealed that the Romanian language falls in the \u201dfragmentary support\u201d category, just above the last, \u201dweak/none\u201d category (see the language/support matrix in (Rehm and Uszkoreit, 2013)).",

This is why, in 2019/2020, we are able to present the \ufb01rst Romanian NER resource. 2. Related Work We note that, while fragmentary, there are a few related lan- guage resources available, but none that speci\ufb01cally target named entities: 2.1. ROCO corpus ROCO7 is a Romanian journalistic corpus that contains ap- prox. 7.1M tokens. It is rich in proper names, numerals and named entities. The corpus has been automatically annotated at word-level with morphosyntactic information (MSD annotations). 2.2. ROMBAC corpus Released in 2016, ROMBAC8 is a Romanian text corpus containing 41M words divided in relatively equal domains like journalism, legalese, \ufb01ction, medicine, etc.",
      "2.2. ROMBAC corpus Released in 2016, ROMBAC8 is a Romanian text corpus containing 41M words divided in relatively equal domains like journalism, legalese, \ufb01ction, medicine, etc. Similarly to ROCO, it is automatically annotated at word level with MSD descriptors. 2.3. CoRoLa corpus The much larger and recently released CoRoLa corpus9 contains over 1B words, similarly automatically annotated. 5Unfortunately, many Romanian language resources have been developed in different funded projects and carry stronger copy- right licenses, including requiring potential users to print/ sign/s- can/send copyright forms, a step that discourages the vast majority of people. 6META-NET website: http://www.meta-net.eu/ 7ROCO ISLRN: 312-617-089-348-7, ELRA-W0085 8ROMBAC ISLRN: 162-192-982-061-0, ELRA-W0088 9CoRoLa available at: http://corola.racai.ro/",
      "In all these corpora the named entities are not a separate category - the texts are morphologically and syntactically annotated and all proper nouns are marked as such - NP - without any other annotation or assigned category. Thus, these corpora cannot be used in a true NER sense. Further- more, annotations were done automatically with a tokeniz- er/tagger/parser, and thus are of slightly lower quality than one would expect of a gold-standard corpus. 3. Corpus Description The corpus, at its current version 1.0 is composed of 5127 sentences, annotated with 16 classes, for a total of 26377 annotated entities. The 16 classes are: PER- SON, NAT REL POL, ORG, GPE, LOC, FACILITY, PRODUCT, EVENT, LANGUAGE, WORK OF ART, DATETIME, PERIOD, MONEY, QUANTITY, NU- MERIC VALUE and ORDINAL. It is based on copyright-free text extracted from Southeast European Times (SETimes) (Tyers and Alperen, 2010). The news portal has published10 \u201cnews and views from Southeast Europe\u201d in ten languages, including Romanian.",
      "It is based on copyright-free text extracted from Southeast European Times (SETimes) (Tyers and Alperen, 2010). The news portal has published10 \u201cnews and views from Southeast Europe\u201d in ten languages, including Romanian. SETimes has been used in the past for several annotated corpora, including parallel corpora for machine translation. For RONEC we have used a hand-picked11 selection of sen- tences belonging to several categories (see table 1 for stylis- tic examples). The corpus contains the standard diacritics in Romanian: letters s, and t, are written with a comma, not with a cedilla (like s\u00b8 and t\u00b8). In Romanian many older texts are written with cedillas instead of commas because full Unicode sup- port in Windows came much later than the classic extended ASCII which only contained the cedilla letters.",
      "In Romanian many older texts are written with cedillas instead of commas because full Unicode sup- port in Windows came much later than the classic extended ASCII which only contained the cedilla letters. The 16 classes are inspired by the OntoNotes5 cor- pus (Weischedel et al., 2013) as well as the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) English Annota- tion Guidelines for Entities Version 6.6 2008.06.13 (Consortium and others, 2005). We dropped 2 classes from OntoNote\u2019s 18 classes12. Each one will be presented in detail, in section 4. A summary of available classes with word counts for each is available in table 2. The corpus is available in two formats: BRAT and CoNLL-U Plus (MWE and IOB styles). 3.1.

Furthermore, DATETIME entities will usually require further sub-processing to extract exact values, something which is out of scope for this corpus. 13BRAT Rapid Annotation Tool: http://brat.nlplab.org/ line environment for collaborative text annotation - a web- based tool where several people can mark words, sub-word pieces, multiple word expressions, can link them together by relations, etc.",

      "4. RONEC Classes For the English language, we found two \u201dcategories\u201d of NER annotations to be more prominent: CoNLL- and ACE- style. Because CoNLL only annotates a few classes (de- pending on the corpora, starting from the basic three: PER- SON, ORGANIZATION and LOCATION, up to seven), we chose to follow the ACE-style with 18 different classes. Af- ter analyzing the ACE guide we have settled on 16 \ufb01nal classes that seemed more appropriate for Romanian, seen in table 2. In the following sub-sections we will describe each class in turn, with a few examples. Some examples have been left in Romanian while some have been translated in English for the reader\u2019s convenience. In the examples at the end of each class\u2019 description, translations in English are colored for easier reading. 4.1. PERSON Persons, including \ufb01ctive characters.

Buildings or other structures which house people, such as homes, factories, stadiums, of\ufb01ce buildings, prisons, museums, tunnels, train stations, etc., named or not. Everything that falls within the archi- tectural and civil engineering domains should be labeled as a FACILITY. We do not mark structures composed of mul- tiple (and distinct) sub-structures, like a named area that is composed of several buildings, or \u201dmicro\u201d-structures such as an apartment (as it a unit of an apartment building).

      "4.11. DATETIME Date and time values. We will mark full constructions, not parts, if they refer to the same moment (e.g. a comma sep- arates two distinct DATETIME entities only if they refer to distinct moments). If we have a well speci\ufb01ed period (e.g. \u201dbetween 20-22 hours\u201d) we mark it as PERIOD, otherwise less well de\ufb01ned periods are marked as DATETIME (e.g.: \u201dlast summer\u201d, \u201dSeptember\u201d, \u201dWednesday\u201d, \u201dthree days\u201d); Ages are marked as DATETIME as well.

MONEY Money, monetary values, including units (e.g. USD, $, RON, lei, francs, pounds, Euro, etc.) written with num- ber or letters. Entities that contain any monetary reference, including measuring units, will be marked as MONEY (e.g. 10$/sqm, 50 lei per hour).

The first place was won by Germany\u2019s team. 5. Annotation Methodology The corpus creation process involved a small number of people that have voluntarily joined the initiative, with the authors of this paper directing the work. Initially, we searched for NER resources in Romanian, and found none. Then we looked at English resources and read the in-depth ACE guide, out of which a 16-class draft evolved. We then identi\ufb01ed a copy-right free text from which we hand-picked sentences to maximize the amount of entities while main- taining style balance. The annotation process was a trial- and-error, with cycles composed of annotation, discussing confusing entities, updating the annotation guide schematic and going through the corpus section again to correct enti- ties following guide changes. The annotation process was done online, in BRAT24.",
      "The annotation process was a trial- and-error, with cycles composed of annotation, discussing confusing entities, updating the annotation guide schematic and going through the corpus section again to correct enti- ties following guide changes. The annotation process was done online, in BRAT24. The actual annotation involved 4 people, has taken about 6 months (as work was volunteer- based, we could not have reached for 100% time commit- ment from the people involved), and followed the steps: 24Please note that while the CoNLLU-Plus MWE format sup- ports multi word entities that are not in a continuous sequence, as we performed the annotation in BRAT, we only annotated multi- word contiguous entities.",
      "1. Each person would annotate the full corpus (this in- cluded the cycles of shaping up the annotation guide, and re-annotation). Inter-annotator agreement (ITA) at this point was relatively low, at 60-70%, especially for a number of classes. 2. We then automatically merged all annotations, with the following criterion: if 3 of the 4 annotators agreed on an entity (class&start-stop), then it would go un- changed; otherwise mark the entity (longest span) as CONFLICTED. 3. Two teams were created, each with two persons. Each team annotated the full corpus again, starting from the previous step. At this point, class-average ITA has risen to over 85%. 4. Next, the same automatic merging happened, this time entities remained unchanged if both annotations agreed. 5. Finally, one of the authors went through the full corpus one more time, correcting disagreements. Notes regarding classes and inter-annotator agreements: \u2022 ORGANIZATION, NAT REL POL, LANGUAGE or GPEs have the highest ITA, over 98%.",
      "5. Finally, one of the authors went through the full corpus one more time, correcting disagreements. Notes regarding classes and inter-annotator agreements: \u2022 ORGANIZATION, NAT REL POL, LANGUAGE or GPEs have the highest ITA, over 98%. \u2022 DATETIME also has a high ITA, with some overlap with PERIOD: annotators could fall-back if they were not sure that an expression was a PERIOD and simply mark it as DATETIME. \u2022 WORK OF ART and EVENTs have caused some problems because the scope could not be properly de- \ufb01ned from just one sentence. For example, a fair in a city could be a local event, but could also be a national periodic event. \u2022 MONEY, QUANTITY and ORDINAL all are more speci\ufb01c classes than NUMERIC VALUE. So, in cases where a numeric value has a unit of measure by it, it should become a QUANTITY, not a NU- MERIC VALUE. However, this \u201dspeci\ufb01city\u201d has cre- ated some confusion between these classes, just like with DATETIME and PERIOD.",

However, this \u201dspeci\ufb01city\u201d has cre- ated some confusion between these classes, just like with DATETIME and PERIOD. \u2022 The ORDINAL class is a bit ambiguous, be- cause, even though it ranks \u201dhigher\u201d than NU- MERIC VALUE, it is the least diverse, most of the entities following the same patterns. \u2022 PRODUCT and FACILITY classes have the lowest ITA by far (less than 40% in the \ufb01rst annotation cycle, less than 70% in the second). We actually considered removing these classes from the annotation process, but to try to mimic the OntoNotes classes as much as possible we decided to keep them in. There were many cases where the annotators disagreed about the scope of words being facilities or products. Even in the ACE guidelines these two classes are not very well \u201ddocumented\u201d with examples of what is and what is not a PRODUCT or FACILITY. Considering that these classes are, in our opinion, of the lowest importance amongst all others, a lower ITA was accepted.",

Considering that these classes are, in our opinion, of the lowest importance amongst all others, a lower ITA was accepted. Finally, we would like to address the \u201dsemantic scope\u201d of the entities - for example, for class PERSON, we do not annotate only proper nouns (NPs) but basically any refer- ence to a person (e.g. through pronouns \u201dshe\u201d, job position titles, common nouns such as \u201dfather\u201d, etc.). We do this because we would like a high-coverage corpus, where en- tities are marked as more semantically-oriented rather than syntactically - in the same way ACE entities are more en- compassing than CoNLL entities 25. 6. Conclusions We have presented RONEC - the \ufb01rst Named Entity Cor- pus for the Romanian language. At its current version, in its 5127 sentences we have 26377 annotated entities in 16 different classes. The corpus is based on copy-right free text, and is released as open-source, free to use and extend.",
      "At its current version, in its 5127 sentences we have 26377 annotated entities in 16 different classes. The corpus is based on copy-right free text, and is released as open-source, free to use and extend. There is also an annotation guide that we will improve, and in time evolve into a full annotation doc- ument like the ACE Annotation Guidelines for Entities (Consortium and others, 2005). We have released the corpus in two formats: CoNLL- U PLus (text-based tab-separated pre-tokenized and an- notated format, in MWE and IOB \ufb02avours) and BRAT (another text-based, non-tokenized format which annotates spans of characters with classes). We also release a spaCy26 pretrained NER model on our GitHub repo for immediate usage. 7. Bibliographical References Boros,, T., Dumitrescu, S. D., and Burtica, R. (2018).
