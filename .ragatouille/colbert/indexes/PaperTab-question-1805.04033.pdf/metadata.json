However, the generated summaries are often inconsistent with the source content in semantics. In such cases, when generating summaries, the model selects semantically unrelated words with respect to the source content as the most probable output. The problem can be attributed to heuristically constructed training data, where summaries can be unrelated to the source content, thus containing semantically unrelated words and spurious word correspondence.

      "The commonly-used large-scale datasets for deep learning models are constructed based on naturally-annotated data with heuristic rules [Chopra et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2015; Nallapati et al. 2016]. The summaries are not written for the source content specifically. It suggests that the provided summary may not be semantically consistent with the source content. For example, the dataset for Chinese social media text summarization, namely LCSTS, contains more than 20% text-summary pairs that are not related, according to the statistics of the manually checked data [Hu et al. 2015].

Table 1 shows an example of semantic inconsistency. Typically, the reference summary contains extra information that cannot be understood from the source content. It is hard to conclude the summary even for a human. Due to the inconsistency, the system cannot extract enough information in the source text, and it would be hard for the model to learn to generate the summary accordingly. The model has to encode spurious correspondence of the summary and the source content by memorization. However, this kind of correspondence is superficial and is not actually needed for generating reasonable summaries. Moreover, the information is harmful to generating semantically consistent summaries, because unrelated information is modeled. For example, the word \u201c\u5229\u76ca\u201d (benefits) in the summary is not related to the source content. Thus, it has to be remembered by the model, together with the source content. However, this correspondence is spurious, because the word \u201c\u5229\u76ca\u201d is not related to any word in the source content.",
      "Thus, it has to be remembered by the model, together with the source content. However, this correspondence is spurious, because the word \u201c\u5229\u76ca\u201d is not related to any word in the source content. In the following, we refer to this problem as Spurious Correspondence caused by the semantically inconsistent data. In this work, we aim to alleviate the impact of the semantic inconsistency of the current dataset. Based on the sequence-to-sequence model, we propose a regularization method to heuristically show down the learning of the spurious correspondence, so that the unrelated information in the dataset is less represented by the model. We incorporate a new soft training target to achieve this goal. For each output time in training, in addition to the gold reference word, the current output also targets at a softened output word distribution that regularizes the current output word distribution. In this way, a more robust correspondence of the source content and the output words can be learned, and potentially, the output summary will be more semantically consistent. To obtain the softened output word distribution, we propose two methods based on the sequence- to-sequence model.",
      "In this way, a more robust correspondence of the source content and the output words can be learned, and potentially, the output summary will be more semantically consistent. To obtain the softened output word distribution, we propose two methods based on the sequence- to-sequence model. \u2022 The first one uses the output layer of the decoder to generate the distribution but with a higher temperature when using softmax normalization. It keeps the relative order of the possible output words but guides the model to keep a smaller discriminative margin. For spurious correspondence, across different examples, the output distribution is more likely to be different, so no effective discriminative margin will be established. For true correspondence, across different examples, the output distribution is more likely to be the same, so a margin can be gradually established. \u2022 The second one introduces an additional output layer to generate the distribution. Analogous to multi-task learning, the additional output layer provides an alternative view of the data, 2",
      "so that it can regularize the output distribution more effectively. Because the additional output layer differs from the original one in that the less stable information, i.e., the spurious correspondence learned by the model itself, is represented differently. Besides, the relative order can also be regularized in this method. More detailed explanation is introduced in Section 2. Another problem for abstractive text summarization is that the system summary cannot be easily evaluated automatically. ROUGE [Lin 2004] is widely used for summarization evaluation. However, as ROUGE is designed for extractive text summarization, it cannot deal with summary paraphrasing in abstractive text summarization. Besides, as ROUGE is based on the reference, it requires high-quality reference summary for a reasonable evaluation, which is also lacking in the existing dataset for Chinese social media text summarization. We argue that for proper evaluation of text generation task, human evaluation cannot be avoided. We propose a simple and practical human evaluation for evaluating text summarization, where the summary is evaluated against the source content instead of the reference. It handles both of the problems of paraphrasing and lack of high-quality reference.",

The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: \u2022 We propose an approach to regularize the output word distribution, so that the semantic inconsistency, e.g. words not related to the source content, exhibited in the training data is un- derrepresented in the model. We add a cross-entropy based regularization term to the overall loss. We also propose two methods to obtain the soft target distribution for regularization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms almost all the existing systems. In particular, the semantic consistency is improved by 4% in terms of human evaluation.

Such kind of evaluation is absent in the existing work of text summarization. In the proposed human evaluation, the summary is evaluated against the source content other than the reference summary, so that it can better measure the consistency of the generated summary and the source content when high-quality reference is not available. 2 PROPOSED METHOD Base on the fact that the spurious correspondence is not stable and its realization in the model is prone to change, we propose to alleviate the issue heuristically by regularization. We use the cross-entropy with an annealed output distribution as the regularization term in the loss so that the little fluctuation in the distribution will be depressed and more robust and stable correspondence will be learned. By correspondence, we mean the relation between (a) the current output, and (b) the source content and the partially generated output. Furthermore, we propose to use an additional output layer to generate the annealed output distribution.",

Due to the same fact, the two output layers will differ more in the words that superficially co-occur, so that the output distribution can be better regularized. 2.1 Regularizing the Neural Network with Annealed Distribution Typically, in the training of the sequence-to-sequence model, only the one-hot hard target is used in the cross-entropy based loss function.

However, as y is the one-hot vector, all the elements are zero except the one representing the correct label. Hence, the loss becomes J(z) = \u2212logzl (2) where l is the index of the correct label. The loss is then summed over the output sentences and across the minibatch and used as the source error signal in the backpropagation. The hard target could cause several problems in the training.

      "The loss is then summed over the output sentences and across the minibatch and used as the source error signal in the backpropagation. The hard target could cause several problems in the training. Soft training methods try to use a soft target distribution to provide a generalized error signal to the training. For the summarization task, a straight-forward way would be to use the current output vector as the soft target, which contains the knowledge learned by the current model, i.e., the correspondence of the source content and the current output word: J(z) = M \u00d5 i=1 \u2212zi logzi (3) Then, the two losses are combined as the new loss function: J(z) = \u2212logzl \u2212\u03b1 M \u00d5 i=1 zi logzi (4) where l is the index of the true label and \u03b1 is the strength of the soft training loss. We refer to this approach as Self-Train (The left part of Figure 1). The output of the model can be seen as a refined supervisory signal for the learning of the model. The added loss promotes the learning of more stable correspondence. The output not only learns from the one-hot distribution but also the distribution generated by the model itself.",
      "The output of the model can be seen as a refined supervisory signal for the learning of the model. The added loss promotes the learning of more stable correspondence. The output not only learns from the one-hot distribution but also the distribution generated by the model itself. However, during the training, the output of the neural network can become too close to the one-hot distribution. To solve this, we make the soft target the soften output distribution. We apply the softmax with temperature \u03c4, which is computed by2 z\u2032 i = exp(zi/\u03c4) \u00cdM j=1 exp(zj/\u03c4) , i = 1, 2, . . . , M (5) 1For the convenience of description, we omit the related trainable parameters of the model. 2It uses simplified notation, where zi and zj should be the unnormalized output, i.e., the output before the softmax operation. 4",
      "This transformation keeps the relative order of the labels, and a higher temperature will make the output distributed more evenly. The key motivation is that if the model is still not confident how to generate the current output word under the supervision of the reference summary, it means the correspondence can be spurious and the reference output is unlikely to be concluded from the source content. It makes no sense to force the model to learn such correspondence. The regularization follows that motivation, and in such case, the error signal will be less significant compared to the one-hot target. In the case where the model is extremely confident how to generate the current output, the annealed distribution will resemble the one-hot target. Thus, the regularization is not effective. In all, we make use of the model itself to identify the spurious correspondence and then regularize the output distribution accordingly. 2.2 Dual Output Layers However, the aforementioned method tries to regularize the output word distribution based on what it has already learned. The relative order of the output words is kept. The self-dependency may not be desirable for regularization. It may be better if more correspondence that is spurious can be identified.",
      "The relative order of the output words is kept. The self-dependency may not be desirable for regularization. It may be better if more correspondence that is spurious can be identified. In this paper, we further propose to obtain the soft target from a different view of the model, so that different knowledge of the dataset can be used to mitigate the overfitting problem. An additional output layer is introduced to generate the soft target. The two output layers share the same hidden representation but have independent parameters. They could learn different knowledge of the data. We refer to this approach as Dual-Train. For clarity, the original output layer is denoted by o(1) and the new output layer o(2). Their outputs are denoted by z(1) and z(2), respectively. The output layer o(1) acts as the original output layer. We apply soft training using the output from o(2) to this output layer to increase its ability of generalization.",
      "Their outputs are denoted by z(1) and z(2), respectively. The output layer o(1) acts as the original output layer. We apply soft training using the output from o(2) to this output layer to increase its ability of generalization. Suppose the correct label is l.

This output layer is not used in the prediction, and its only purpose is to generate the soft target to facilitate the soft training of o(1). Suppose the correct label is l. The target of the output z(2) includes only the one-hot distribution: J(z(2)) = \u2212logz(2) l (7) Because of the random initialization of the parameters in the output layers, o(1) and o(2) could learn different things.",
      "The diversified knowledge is helpful when dealing with the spurious correspon- dence in the data. It can also be seen as an online kind of ensemble methods. Several different instances of the same model are softly aggregated into one to make classification. The right part of Figure 1 shows the architecture of the proposed Dual-Train method. 3 EXPERIMENTS We evaluate the proposed approach on the Chinese social media text summarization task, based on the sequence-to-sequence model. We also analyze the output text and the output label distribution of the models, showing the power of the proposed approach. Finally, we show the cases where the correspondences learned by the proposed approach are still problematic, which can be explained based on the approach we adopt. 5",
      "3.1 Dataset Large-Scale Chinese Short Text Summarization Dataset (LCSTS) is constructed by [Hu et al. 2015].

The whole dataset is split into three parts, with 2,400,591 pairs in PART I for training, 10,666 pairs in PART II for validation, and 1,106 pairs in PART III for testing. The authors of the dataset have manually annotated the relevance scores, ranging from 1 to 5, of the text-summary pairs in PART II and PART III. They suggested that only pairs with scores no less than three should be used for evaluation, which leaves 8,685 pairs in PART II, and 725 pairs in PART III. From the statistics of the PART II and PART III, we can see that more than 20% of the pairs are dropped to maintain semantic quality.

We use a very simple setting for all tasks, and set \u03c4 = 2, \u03b1 = 1. We pre-train the model without applying the soft training objective for 5 epochs out of total 10 epochs. We use the Adam optimizer [Kingma and Ba 2014] for all the tasks, using the default settings with \u03b1 = 0.001, \u03b20 = 0.999, and \u03b21 = 0.9.

      "We report the test results at the epoch that achieves the best score on the development set. 3.3 Evaluation Protocol For text summarization, a common automatic evaluation method is ROUGE [Lin 2004]. The gener- ated summary is evaluated against the reference summary, based on unigram recall (ROUGE-1), bigram recall (ROUGE-2), and recall of longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L). To facilitate comparison with the existing systems, we adopt ROUGE as the automatic evaluation method. The ROUGE is calculated on the character level, following the previous work [Hu et al. 2015]. However, for abstractive text summarization, the ROUGE is sub-optimal, and cannot assess the semantic consistency between the summary and the source content, especially when there is only one reference for a piece of text. The reason is that the same content may be expressed in different ways with different focuses. Simple word match cannot recognize the paraphrasing. It is the case for all of the existing large-scale datasets. Besides, as aforementioned, ROUGE is calculated on the character level in Chinese text summarization, making the metrics favor the models on the character level in practice.",

In Chinese, a word is the smallest semantic element that can be uttered in isolation, not a character. In the extreme case, the generated text could be completely intelligible, but the characters could still match. In theory, calculating ROUGE metrics on the word level could alleviate the problem. However, word segmentation is also a non-trivial task for Chinese. There are many kinds of segmentation rules, which will produce different ROUGE scores.

      "is not acceptable to introduce additional systematic bias in automatic evaluations, and automatic evaluation for semantically related tasks can only serve as a reference. To avoid the deficiencies, we propose a simple human evaluation method to assess the semantic consistency. Each summary candidate is evaluated against the text rather than the reference. If the candidate is irrelevant or incorrect to the text, or the candidate is not understandable, the candidate is labeled bad. Otherwise, the candidate is labeled good. Then, we can get an accuracy of the good summaries. The proposed evaluation is very simple and straight-forward. It focuses on the relevance between the summary and the text. The semantic consistency should be the major consideration when putting the text summarization methods into practice, but the current automatic methods cannot judge properly. For detailed guidelines in human evaluation, please refer to Appendix A. In the human evaluation, the text-summary pairs are dispatched to two human annotators who are native speakers of Chinese. As in our setting the summary is evaluated against the reference, the number of the pairs needs to be manually evaluated is four times the number of the pairs in the test set, because we need to compare four systems in total.",

We first randomly select 100 pairs in the validation set for the two human annotators to evaluate. Each pair is annotated twice, and the inter-annotator agreement is checked. We find that under the protocol, the inter-annotator agreement is quite high. In the evaluation of the test set, a pair is only annotated once to accelerate evaluation.

As we can see, Dual-Train improves the accuracy by 4%. Due to the rigorous definition of being good, the results mean that 4% more of the summaries are semantically consistent with their source content. However, Self-Train has a performance drop compared to the baseline. After investigating its generated summaries, we find that the major reason is that the generated summaries are not grammatically complete and often stop too early, although the generated part is indeed more related to the source content. Because the definition of being good, the improved relevance does not make up the loss on intelligibility. 7",

      "As we can see, only applying soft training without adaptation (Self-Train) hurts the performance. With the additional output layer (Dual-Train), the performance can be greatly improved over the baseline. Moreover, with the proposed method the simple baseline model is second to the best compared with the state-of-the-art models and even surpasses in ROUGE-2. It is promising that applying the proposed method to the state-of-the-art model could also improve its performance. The automatic evaluation is done on the original test set to facilitate comparison with existing work. However, a more reasonable setting would be to exclude the 52 test instances that are found bad in the human evaluation, because the quality of the automatic evaluation depends on the reference summary. As the existing methods do not provide their test output, it is a non-trivial task to reproduce all their results of the same reported performance. Nonetheless, it does not change the fact that ROUGE cannot handle the issues in abstractive text summarization properly.",

Nonetheless, it does not change the fact that ROUGE cannot handle the issues in abstractive text summarization properly. 3.5 Experimental Analysis To examine the effect of the proposed method and reveal how the proposed method improves the consistency, we compare the output of the baseline with Dual-Train, based on both the output text and the output label distribution. We also conduct error analysis to discover room for improvements. 3.5.1 Analysis of the Output Text. To gain a better understanding of the results, we analyze the summaries generated by the baseline model and our proposed model. Some of the summaries are listed in Table 4. As shown in the table, the summaries generated by the proposed method are much better than the baseline, and we believe they are more precise and informative than the references.

      "We can obtain the most related words of a word by simply selecting the highest values from its representation. Table 5 lists some of the labels and the top 4 labels that are most likely to replace each of the labels. It is a hint about the correspondence learned by the model. From the results, it can be observed that Dual-Train learns the better semantic relevance of a word compared to the baseline because the spurious word correspondence is alleviated by regularization. For example, the possible substitutes of the word \u201c\u591a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u201d (how long) considered by Dual-Train include \u201c\u591a\u5c11\u201d (how many), \u201c\u591a\u4e45\u201d (how long) and \u201c\u65f6\u95f4\u201d (time). However, the relatedness is learned poorly in the baseline, as there is \u201c\u77e5\u9053\u201d (know), a number, and two particles in the possible substitutes considered by the baseline. Another representative example is the word \u201c\u56fe\u50cf\u201d (image), where the baseline also includes two particles in its most related words. The phenomenon shows that the baseline suffers from spurious correspondence in the data, and learns noisy and harmful relations, which rely too much on the co-occurrence.",
      "Another representative example is the word \u201c\u56fe\u50cf\u201d (image), where the baseline also includes two particles in its most related words. The phenomenon shows that the baseline suffers from spurious correspondence in the data, and learns noisy and harmful relations, which rely too much on the co-occurrence. In contrast, the proposed method can capture more stable semantic relatedness of the words. For text summarization, grouping the words that are in the same topic together can help the model to generate sentences that are more coherent and can improve the quality of the summarization and the relevance to the source content. Although the proposed method resolves a large number of the noisy word relations, there are still cases that the less related words are not eliminated. For example, the top 4 most similar words of \u201c\u671f\u8d27\u4e1a\u201d (futures industry) from the proposed method include \u201c\u6539\u9769\u201d (reform). It is more related than \u201c2013\u201d from the baseline, but it can still be harmful to text summarization. The problem could arise from the fact that words as \u201c\u671f\u8d27\u4e1a\u201d rarely occur in the training data, and their relatedness is not reflected in the data.",

Another issue is that there are some particles, e.g., \u201c\u7684\u201d (DE) in the most related words. A possible explanation is that particles show up too often in the contexts of the word, and it is hard for the models to distinguish them from the real semantically-related words. 10",
      "As our proposed approach is based on regularization of the less common correspondence, it is reasonable that such kind of relation cannot be eliminated. The first case can be categorized into data sparsity, which usually needs the aid of knowledge bases to solve. The second case is due to the characteristics of natural language. However, as such words are often closed class words, the case can be resolved by manually restricting the relatedness of these words. 4 RELATED WORK Related work includes efforts on designing models for the Chinese social media text summarization task and the efforts on obtaining soft training target for supervised learning. 4.1 Systems for Chinese Social Media Text Summarization The Large-Scale Chinese Short Text Summarization dataset was proposed by [Hu et al. 2015]. Along with the datasets, [Hu et al. 2015] also proposed two systems to solve the task, namely RNN and RNN-context. They were two sequence-to-sequence based models with GRU as the encoder and the decoder. The difference between them was that RNN-context had attention mechanism while RNN did not. They conducted experiments both on the character level and on the word level. RNN-distract [Chen et al.",

The copy mechanism also explained that the results of their word-level model were better than the results of their character-level model. SRB [Ma et al. 2017] was a sequence-to-sequence based neural model to improve the semantic relevance between the input text and the output summary. DRGD [Li et al. 2017] was a deep recurrent generative decoder model, combining the decoder with a variational autoencoder. 4.2 Methods for Obtaining Soft Training Target Soft target aims to refine the supervisory signal in supervised learning.

      "4.2 Methods for Obtaining Soft Training Target Soft target aims to refine the supervisory signal in supervised learning. Related work includes soft target for traditional learning algorithms and model distillation for deep learning algorithms. The soft label methods are typically for binary classification [Nguyen et al. 2014], where the human annotators not only assign a label for an example but also give information on how confident they are regarding the annotation. The main difference from our method is that the soft label methods require additional annotation information (e.g., the confidence information of the annotated labels) of the training data, which is costly in the text summarization task. There have also been prior studies on model distillation in deep learning that distills big models into a smaller one. Model distillation [Hinton et al. 2014] combined different instances of the same model into a single one. It used the output distributions of the previously trained models as the soft target distribution to train a new model. A similar work to model distillation is the soft-target regularization method [Aghajanyan 2016] for image classification.",
      "It used the output distributions of the previously trained models as the soft target distribution to train a new model. A similar work to model distillation is the soft-target regularization method [Aghajanyan 2016] for image classification. Instead of using the outputs of other instances, it used an exponential average of the past label distributions of the current instance as the soft target distribution. The proposed method is different compared with the existing model distillation methods, in that the proposed method does not require additional models or additional space to record the past soft label distributions. The existing methods are not suitable for text summarization tasks, because the training of an additional model is costly, and the additional space is huge due to the massive number of data. The proposed method uses its current state as the soft target distribution and eliminates the need to train additional models or to store the history information. 11",
      "5 CONCLUSIONS We propose a regularization approach for the sequence-to-sequence model on the Chinese social media summarization task. In the proposed approach, we use a cross-entropy based regularization term to make the model neglect the possible unrelated words. We propose two methods for obtaining the soft output word distribution used in the regularization, of which Dual-Train proves to be more effective. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the semantic consistency by 4% in terms of human evaluation. As shown by the analysis, the proposed method achieves the improvements by eliminating the less semantically-related word correspondence. The proposed human evaluation method is effective and efficient in judging the semantic con- sistency, which is absent in previous work but is crucial in the accurate evaluation of the text summarization systems. The proposed metric is simple to conduct and easy to interpret. It also provides an insight on how practicable the existing systems are in the real-world scenario.

If the summary is not understandable, relevant or correct according to the source content, the summary is considered bad. More concretely, the annotators are asked to examine the following aspects to determine whether the summary is good: (1) Fluency. If the summary itself cannot be understood, the summary is not good. This is not judged by grammatical correctness but by checking if major semantic roles, such as the predicate, the agent, and the experiencer, are missing. It allows the summary where certain 12",
      "particles (e.g., \u201c\u7684\u201d or aspect markers (e.g., \u201c\u4e86\u201d) are missing but the content can still be understood. Another common issue is that the summary may have repeated words. Our view on this is that if the repetition does not affect the intelligibility of the summary, we still treat the summary as good. (2) Relatedness. If it is impossible to decide whether the summary is correct or wrong according to the source content, the summary is bad. By definition, the nonsense is also ruled out. (3) Faithfulness. If the summary is not correct according to the source content, the summary is labeled bad. We also treat the summary that is relevant and correct according to the source content but is too general as bad. If a rule is not met, the summary is labeled bad, and the following rules do not need to be checked. In Table 6, we give examples for cases of each rule. In the first one, the summary is not fluent, because the patient of the predicate \u201c\u627e\u201d (seek for) is missing.",
      "In Table 6, we give examples for cases of each rule. In the first one, the summary is not fluent, because the patient of the predicate \u201c\u627e\u201d (seek for) is missing. The second summary is fluent, but the content is not related to the source, in that we cannot determine if Lei Jun is actually fighting the scalpers based on the source content. In the third one, the summary is fluent and related to the source content, but the facts are wrong, as the summary is made up by facts of different people. The last one met all the three rules, and thus it is considered good. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61673028.
