  "Based on this text corpus, a topic model was \ufb01rst constructed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For a subsample of 503 songs, scores for predicting perceived musical hardness/heaviness and darkness/gloominess were extracted using audio feature models. By combining both audio feature and text analysis, we (1) offer a comprehensive overview of the lyrical topics present within the metal genre and (2) are able to establish whether or not levels of hardness and other music dimensions are associated with the occurrence of particularly harsh (and other) textual topics. Twenty typical topics were identi\ufb01ed and projected into a topic space using multidimensional scaling (MDS). After Bonferroni correction, positive correlations were found between musical hardness and darkness and textual topics dealing with \u2018brutal death\u2019, \u2018dystopia\u2019, \u2018archaisms and occultism\u2019, \u2018religion and satanism\u2019, \u2018battle\u2019 and \u2018(psychological) madness\u2019, while there is a negative associations with topics like \u2018personal life\u2019 and \u2018love and romance\u2019.",
  "Keywords Metal Music \u00b7 Topic Modeling \u00b7 Latent Dirichlet Allocation \u00b7 Audio Feature Extraction 1 Introduction As audio and text features provide complementary layers of information on songs, a combination of both data types has been shown to improve the automatic classi\ufb01cation of high-level attributes in music such as genre, mood and emotion [18, 14, 11, 12]. Multi-modal approaches inter- linking these features offer insights into possible relations between lyrical and musical information (see [19, 16, 31]). In the case of metal music, sound dimensions like loud- ness, distortion and particularly hardness (or heaviness) play an essential role in de\ufb01ning the sound of this genre [1, 25, 17, 10]. Speci\ufb01c subgenres \u2013 especially doom metal, gothic metal and black metal \u2013 are further associated with a sound that is often described as dark or gloomy [21, 30]. These characteristics are typically not limited to the acous- tic and musical level. In a research strand that has so far been generally treated separately from the audio di- mensions, lyrics from the metal genre have come under relatively close scrutiny (cf. [9]).",

Topics typically ascribed to metal lyrics include sadness, death, freedom, nature, occultism or unpleasant/disgusting objects and are over- arXiv:1911.04952v2  [eess.AS]  13 Nov 2019",
  "\u2018Warriors of the Word\u2019 - Deciphering Lyrical Topics in Music and Their Connection to Audio Feature Dimensions Based on a Corpus of Over 100,000 Metal Songs A PREPRINT Figure 1: Processing steps of the approach illustrating the parallel analysis of text and audio features all characterized as harsh, gloomy, dystopian, or satanic [23, 9, 28, 22, 5]. Until now, investigations on metal lyrics were limited to individual cases or relatively small corpora \u2013 with a max- imum of 1,152 songs in [5]. Besides this, the relation between the musical and the textual domain has not yet been explored. Therefore, we examine a large corpus of metal song lyrics, addressing the following questions: 1. Which topics are present within the corpus of metal lyrics? 2. Is there a connection between characteristic mu- sical dimensions like hardness and darkness and certain topics occurring within the textual do- main? 2 Methodology In our sequential research design, the distribution of tex- tual topics within the corpus was analyzed using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).",
  "2. Is there a connection between characteristic mu- sical dimensions like hardness and darkness and certain topics occurring within the textual do- main? 2 Methodology In our sequential research design, the distribution of tex- tual topics within the corpus was analyzed using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This resulted in a topic model, which was used for a probabilistic assignment of topics to each of the song documents. Additionally, for a subset of these songs, audio features were extracted using models for high-level music dimensions. The use of automatic models for the extraction of both text as well as musical features allows for scalability as it enables a large corpus to be studied without depending on the process of manual annotation for each of the songs. The resulting feature vec- tors were then subjected to a correlation analysis. Figure 1 outlines the sequence of the steps taken in processing the data. The individual steps are explained in the following subsections. 2.1 Text Corpus Creation and Cleaning For gathering the data corpus, a web crawler was pro- grammed using the Python packages Requests and BeautifulSoup. In total, 152,916 metal music lyrics were extracted from www.darklyrics.com.",
  "The individual steps are explained in the following subsections. 2.1 Text Corpus Creation and Cleaning For gathering the data corpus, a web crawler was pro- grammed using the Python packages Requests and BeautifulSoup. In total, 152,916 metal music lyrics were extracted from www.darklyrics.com. Using Python\u2019s langdetect package, all non-English texts were excluded. With the help of regular expres- sions, the texts were scanned for tokens indicating meta- information, which is not part of the actual lyrics. To this end, a list of stopwords referring to musical instruments or the production process (e.g. \u2018recorded\u2019, \u2018mixed\u2019, \u2018ar- rangement by\u2019, \u2018band photos\u2019) was de\ufb01ned in addition to common stopwords. After these cleaning procedures, 124,288 texts remained in the subsample. For text nor- malization, stemming and lemmatization were applied as further preprocessing steps. 2.2 Topic Modelling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation We performed a LDA [2] on the remaining subsample to construct a probabilistic topic model. The LDA models were created by using the Python library Gensim [24].",
  "2.2 Topic Modelling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation We performed a LDA [2] on the remaining subsample to construct a probabilistic topic model. The LDA models were created by using the Python library Gensim [24]. The lyrics were \ufb01rst converted to a bag-of-words format, and standard weighting of terms provided by the Gensim package was applied. Log perplexity [6, p. 4] and log UMass coherence [26, p. 2] were calculated as goodness-of-\ufb01t measures evaluating topic models ranging from 10 to 100 topics. Considering these performance measures as well as qualitative inter- pretability of the resulting topic models, we chose a topic model including 20 topics \u2013 an approach comparable with [29]. We then examined the most salient and most typical words for each topic. Moreover, we used the ldavis package to analyze the structure of the resulting topic space [27]. In order to do so, the Jensen-Shannon divergence between topics was calculated in a \ufb01rst step. In a second step, we applied multidimensional scaling (MDS) to project the inter-topic distances onto a two-dimensional plane.",
  "In order to do so, the Jensen-Shannon divergence between topics was calculated in a \ufb01rst step. In a second step, we applied multidimensional scaling (MDS) to project the inter-topic distances onto a two-dimensional plane. MDS is based on the idea of calculating dissimilarities between pairs of items of an input matrix while minimizing the strain func- tion [4]. In this case, the closer the topics are located to one another on the two-dimensional plane, the more they share salient terms and the more likely a combination of these topics appear in a song. 2.3 High-Level Audio Feature Extraction The high-level audio feature models used had been con- structed in previous examinations [7, 8]. In those music perception studies, ratings were obtained for 212 music stimuli in an online listening experiment by 40 raters. 2",

We opted for Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 since it does not assume normal distribution of the data, is less prone to outliers and zero-in\ufb02ation than Pearson\u2019s r. Bonferroni correction was applied in order to account for multiple-testing. 3 Results 3.1 Textual Topics Table 1 displays the twenty resulting topics found within the text corpus using LDA. The topics are numbered in descending order according to their prevalence (weight) in the text corpus. For each topic, a qualitative interpretation is given along with the 10 most salient terms1. The salient terms of the \ufb01rst topic \u2013 and in parts also the second \u2013 appear relatively generic, as terms like e.g. \u2018know\u2019, \u2018never\u2019, and \u2018time\u2019 occur in many contexts.",

How- ever, the majority of the remaining topics reveal distinct lyrical themes described as being characteristic for the metal genre. \u2018Religion & satanism\u2019 (topic #5) and descrip- tions of \u2018brutal death\u2019 (topic #7) can be considered as being typical for black metal and death metal respectively, whereas \u2018battle\u2019 (topic #6), \u2018landscape & journey\u2019 (topic #11), \u2018struggle for freedom\u2019 (topic #12), and \u2018dystopia\u2019 (topic #15), are associated with power metal and other metal subgenres. 1Note that the terms are presented in their stemmed form (e.g. \u2018\ufb02i\u2019 instead of \u2018\ufb02y\u2019 or \u2018\ufb02ying\u2019). 3",

Here, the topic distributions for two exemplary bands contained within the sample are presented. For these heat maps, data has been aggregated over individual songs showing the topic distri- bution at the level of albums over a band\u2019s history. The examples chosen illustrate the dependence between tex- tual topics and musical subgenres. For the band Manowar, which is associated with the genre of heavy metal, power metal or true metal, a prevalence of topic #6 (\u2018battle\u2019) can be observed, while a distinctive prevalence of topic #7 (\u2018brutal death\u2019) becomes apparent for Cannibal Corpse \u2013 a band belonging to the subgenre of death metal.",
  "Within the topic con\ufb01guration obtained via multidimen- sional scaling (see Figure 3), two latent dimensions can be identi\ufb01ed. The \ufb01rst dimension (PC1) distinguishes topics with more common wordings on the right hand side from topics with less common wording on the left hand side. This also correlates with the weight of the topics within the corpus. The second dimension (PC2) is characterized by an contrast between transcendent and sinister topics dealing with occultism, metaphysics, satanism, darkness, and mourning (#9, #3, .#5, #13, and #16) at the top and comparatively shallow content dealing with personal life and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll lifestyle using a rather mundane or vulgar vocabulary (#1, #8, and #19) at the bottom.

The results are visualized in Figure 4 and the \u03c1 values listed in table 1. Signi\ufb01cant positive associations can be observed between musical hardness and the topics \u2018brutal death\u2019, \u2018dystopia\u2019, \u2018archaisms & occultism\u2019, \u2018religion & satanism\u2019, and \u2018bat- tle\u2019, while it is negatively linked to relatively mundane top- ics concerning \u2018personal life\u2019 and \u2018love & romance\u2019. The situation is similar for dark/gloomy sounding music, which in turn is speci\ufb01cally related to themes such as \u2018dystopia\u2019 and \u2018(psychological) madness\u2019. Overall, the strength of the associations is moderate at best, with a tendency to- wards higher associations for hardness than darkness.",
  "Overall, the strength of the associations is moderate at best, with a tendency to- wards higher associations for hardness than darkness. The strongest association exists between hardness and the topic \u2018brutal death\u2019 (\u03c1 = 0.267, p < 0.012). 4 Conclusion and Outlook Applying the example of metal music, our work examined the textual topics found in song lyrics and investigated the association between these topics and high-level mu- sic features. By using LDA and MDS in order to explore prevalent topics and the topic space, typical text topics identi\ufb01ed in qualitative analyses could be con\ufb01rmed and objecti\ufb01ed based on a large text corpus. These include e.g. satanism, dystopia or disgusting objects. It was shown that musical hardness is particularly associated with harsh top- ics like \u2018brutal death\u2019 and \u2018dystopia\u2019, while it is negatively linked to relatively mundane topics concerning personal life and love. We expect that even stronger correlations could be found for metal-speci\ufb01c topics when including 2The p values fall below the Bonferroni-corrected signi\ufb01cance level.",
  "We expect that even stronger correlations could be found for metal-speci\ufb01c topics when including 2The p values fall below the Bonferroni-corrected signi\ufb01cance level. 3The previously established ground truth for the creation of the audio feature models included far more genres. Therefore, it can be assumed that our metal sample covers only a small fraction of the darkness/hardness range. 5",
  "\u2018Warriors of the Word\u2019 - Deciphering Lyrical Topics in Music and Their Connection to Audio Feature Dimensions Based on a Corpus of Over 100,000 Metal Songs A PREPRINT more genres covering a wider range of hardness/darkness values3. Therefore, we suggest transferring the method to a sample including multiple genres. Moreover, an integration with metadata such as genre information would allow for the testing of associations between topics, genres and high- level audio features. This could help to better understand the role of different domains in an overall perception of genre-de\ufb01ning attributes such as hardness. References [1] Berger, H. M. and Fales, C.
