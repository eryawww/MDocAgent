Bowden and Marilyn Walker Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab University of California, Santa Cruz {jjuraska,kkbowden,mawalker}@ucsc.edu Abstract The uptake of deep learning in natural lan- guage generation (NLG) led to the release of both small and relatively large parallel corpora for training neural models. The existing data- to-text datasets are, however, aimed at task- oriented dialogue systems, and often thus lim- ited in diversity and versatility. They are typ- ically crowdsourced, with much of the noise left in them. Moreover, current neural NLG models do not take full advantage of large training data, and due to their strong gener- alizing properties produce sentences that look template-like regardless.",
      "They are typ- ically crowdsourced, with much of the noise left in them. Moreover, current neural NLG models do not take full advantage of large training data, and due to their strong gener- alizing properties produce sentences that look template-like regardless. We therefore present a new corpus of 7K samples, which (1) is clean despite being crowdsourced, (2) has utterances of 9 generalizable and conversational dialogue act types, making it more suitable for open- domain dialogue systems, and (3) explores the domain of video games, which is new to dia- logue systems despite having excellent poten- tial for supporting rich conversations. 1 Introduction The recent adoption of deep learning methods in natural language generation (NLG) for dialogue systems resulted in an explosion of neural data- to-text generation models, which depend on large training data. These are typically trained on one of the few parallel corpora publicly available, in particular the E2E (Novikova et al., 2017) and the WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) datasets.",
      "These are typically trained on one of the few parallel corpora publicly available, in particular the E2E (Novikova et al., 2017) and the WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) datasets. Crowd- sourcing large NLG datasets tends to be a costly and time-consuming process, making it impracti- cal outside of task-oriented dialogue systems. At the same time, current neural NLG models strug- gle to replicate the high language diversity of the training sentences present in these large datasets, and instead they learn to produce the same generic type of sentences as with considerably less train- ing data (Deriu and Cieliebak, 2018; Juraska and Walker, 2018; Du\u02c7sek et al., 2019). give opinion(NAME [SpellForce 3], RATING [poor], GENRES [real-time strategy, role-playing], PLAY- ER PERSPECTIVE [bird view]) I think that SpellForce 3 is one of the worst games I\u2019ve ever played.

The DA of the MRs is indicated in italics, and the slots in small caps. The slot mentions in the utterances are bolded. Motivated by the rising interest in open-domain dialogue systems and conversational agents, we present ViGGO \u2013 a smaller but more comprehen- sive dataset in the video game domain, introducing several generalizable dialogue acts (DAs), mak- ing it more suitable for training versatile and more conversational NLG models.1 The dataset pro- vides almost 7K pairs of structured meaning repre- sentations (MRs) and crowdsourced reference ut- terances about more than 100 video games.",
      "Ta- ble 1 lists three examples. Video games are a vast entertainment topic that can naturally be discussed in a casual conversa- tion, similar to movies and music, yet in the dia- logue systems community it does not enjoy pop- ularity anywhere close to that of the latter two topics (Fazel-Zarandi et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Moghe et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2018; Khatri et al., 2018). Restaurants have served as the go-to topic in data-to-text NLG for decades, as they offer a suf\ufb01ciently large set of various attributes and cor- 1The ViGGO corpus is available for download at: https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/viggo arXiv:1910.12129v1  [cs.CL]  26 Oct 2019",

While they cer- tainly can be a topic of a casual conversation, the existing restaurant datasets (Stent et al., 2004; Ga\u02c7si\u00b4c et al., 2008; Mairesse et al., 2010; Howcroft et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2015a; Nayak et al., 2017) are geared more toward a task-oriented dialogue where a system tries to narrow down a restaurant based on the user\u2019s preferences and ultimately give a recommendation. Our new video game dataset is designed to be more conversational, and to thus enable neural models to produce utterances more suitable for an open-domain dialogue system. Even the most recent addition to the publicly available restaurant datasets for data-to-text NLG, the E2E dataset (Novikova et al., 2017), suffers from the lack of a conversational aspect. It has be- come popular, thanks to its unprecedented size and multiple reference utterances per MR, for training end-to-end neural models, yet it only provides a single DA type.",
      "It has be- come popular, thanks to its unprecedented size and multiple reference utterances per MR, for training end-to-end neural models, yet it only provides a single DA type. In contrast with the E2E dataset, ViGGO presents utterances of 9 different DAs. Other domains have been represented by task- oriented datasets with multiple DA types, for ex- ample the Hotel, Laptop, and TV datasets (Wen et al., 2015b, 2016). Nevertheless, the DAs in these datasets vary greatly in complexity, and their distribution is thus heavily skewed, typically with two or three similar DAs comprising almost the entire dataset. In our video game dataset, we omit- ted simple DAs, in particular those that do not re- quire any slots, such as greetings or short prompts, and focused on a set of substantial DAs only.",
      "In our video game dataset, we omit- ted simple DAs, in particular those that do not re- quire any slots, such as greetings or short prompts, and focused on a set of substantial DAs only. The main contribution of our work is thus a new parallel data-to-text NLG corpus that (1) is more conversational, rather than information seeking or question answering, and thus more suitable for an open-domain dialogue system, (2) represents a new, unexplored domain which, however, has ex- cellent potential for application in conversational agents, and (3) has high-quality, manually cleaned human-produced utterances. 2 The ViGGO Dataset ViGGO features more than 100 different video game titles, whose attributes were harvested us- ing free API access to two of the largest online video game databases: IGDB2 and GiantBomb3.

With the goal of creating a clean, high-quality dataset, we strived to obtain reference utterances with correct mentions of all slots in the corre- sponding MR through post-processing. 2.1 Meaning Representations The MRs in the ViGGO dataset range from 1 to 8 slot-value pairs, and the slots come from a set of 14 different video game attributes.

Table 2 details how these slots may be distributed across the 9 dif- ferent DAs. The inform DA, represented by 3,000 samples, is the most prevalent one, as the average number of slots it contains is signi\ufb01cantly higher than that of all the other DAs. Figure 1 visual- izes the MR length distribution across the entire dataset. The slots can be classi\ufb01ed into 5 general cat- egories covering most types of information MRs typically convey in data-to-text generation scenar-",

The \ufb01rst 4 categories are common in other NLG datasets, such as E2E, Laptop, TV, and Ho- tel, while the List slots are unique to ViGGO. List slots have values which may comprise multiple items from a discrete list of possible items. 2.2 Utterances With neural language generation in mind, we crowdsourced 3 reference utterances for each MR so as to provide the models with the information about how the same content can be realized in multiple different ways. At the same time, this al- lows for a more reliable automatic evaluation by comparing the generated utterances with a set of different references each, covering a broader spec- trum of correct ways of expressing the content given by the MR. The raw data, however, contains a signi\ufb01cant amount of noise, as is inevitable when crowdsourcing. We therefore created and enforced a robust set of heuristics and regular expressions to account for typos, grammatical errors, undesirable abbreviations, unsolicited information, and miss- ing or incorrect slot realizations.",
      "We therefore created and enforced a robust set of heuristics and regular expressions to account for typos, grammatical errors, undesirable abbreviations, unsolicited information, and miss- ing or incorrect slot realizations. 2.3 Data Collection The crowdsourcing of utterances on MTurk took place in three stages. After collecting one third of the utterances, we identi\ufb01ed a pool of almost 30 workers who wrote the most diverse and natural- sounding sentences in the context of video games. We then \ufb01ltered out all utterances of poor quality and had the quali\ufb01ed workers write new ones for the corresponding inputs. Finally, the remaining two thirds of utterances were completed by these workers exclusively. For each DA we created a separate task in order to minimize the workers\u2019 confusion. The instruc- tions contained several different examples, as well as counter-examples, and they situated the DA in the context of a hypothetical conversation. The video game attributes to be used were provided for the workers in the form of a table, with their order shuf\ufb02ed so as to avoid any kind of bias.",

We maintained a similar MR length and slot distribu- tion across the three partitions.

With the exact parti- tion sizes indicated in the diagram, the \ufb01nal ratio of samples is approximately 7.5 : 1 : 1.5. 2.5 ViGGO vs. E2E Our new dataset was constructed under different constraints than the E2E dataset. First, in ViGGO we did not allow any omissions of slot mentions, as those are not justi\ufb01able for data-to-text gen- eration with no previous context, and it makes the evaluation ambiguous. Second, the MRs in ViGGO are grounded by real video game data, which can encourage richer and more natural- sounding reference utterances.",
      "Second, the MRs in ViGGO are grounded by real video game data, which can encourage richer and more natural- sounding reference utterances. While ViGGO is only 13% the size of the E2E dataset, the lexical diversity of its utterances is 77% of that in the E2E dataset, as indicated by the \u201cdelexicalized vocabulary\u201d column in Table 3. Part of the reason naturally is the presence of ad- ditional DAs in ViGGO, and therefore we also in- dicate the statistics in Table 3 for the inform sam- ples only. The average inform utterance length in ViGGO turns out to be over 30% greater, in terms of both words and sentences per utterance. Finally, we note that, unlike the E2E dataset, our test set does not place any speci\ufb01c emphasis on longer MRs. While the average number of slots per MR in the inform DAs are comparable to the E2E dataset, in general the video game MRs are signi\ufb01cantly shorter. This is by design, as shorter, more focused responses are more conversational than consistently dense utterances.",

Before train- ing the model on the ViGGO dataset, we con- \ufb01rmed on the E2E dataset that it performed on par with, or even slightly better than, the strong baseline models from the E2E NLG Challenge4, namely, TGEN (Du\u02c7sek and Jur\u02c7c\u00b4\u0131\u02c7cek, 2016) and SLUG2SLUG (Juraska et al., 2018). Automatic Metrics We evaluate our model\u2019s performance on the ViGGO dataset using the following standard NLG metrics: BLEU (Pap- ineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), and CIDEr (Vedan- tam et al., 2015).",

We de\ufb01ne naturalness as a measure of how much one would expect to encounter an utter- ance in a conversation with a human, as opposed to sounding robotic, while coherence measures its grammaticality and \ufb02uency. Out of the 120 MRs in each partition, 40 were of the inform type, with the other 8 DAs represented by 10 samples each. In addition to that, we had the annotators rate a sample of 80 utterances from the E2E dataset (40 generated and 40 references) as a sort of a baseline for the human evaluation. With both datasets, our model\u2019s outputs were highly rated on both naturalness and coherence (see Table 5). The scores for the ViGGO utter- ances were overall higher than those for the E2E ones, which we understand as an indication of the video game data being more \ufb02uent and conversa- tional.",
      "The scores for the ViGGO utter- ances were overall higher than those for the E2E ones, which we understand as an indication of the video game data being more \ufb02uent and conversa- tional. At the same time, we observed that the ut- terances generated by our model tended to score higher than the reference utterances, though sig- ni\ufb01cantly more so for the E2E dataset. This is likely a consequence of the ViGGO dataset being cleaner and less noisy than the E2E dataset. In an additional evaluation of ViGGO, we asked the annotators to classify the utterance samples into the 9 DA groups. For this task they were pro- vided with a brief description of each DA type. The annotators identi\ufb01ed the DA incorrectly in only 7% of the samples, which we interpret as a con\ufb01rmation that our DAs are well-de\ufb01ned. Most of the mistakes can be ascribed to the inherent sim- ilarity of the recommend and the suggest DA, as",
      "well as to our model often generating give opinion utterances that resemble the inform ones. Qualitative Analysis Among all 9 DAs, the one posing the greatest challenge for our model was give opinion, due to its high diversity of reference utterances. Despite the occasional incoherence, it learned to produce rich and sensible utterances, for instance \u201cLittle Nightmares is a pretty good game. Tarsier Studios is a talented developer and the side view perspective makes it easy to play.\u201d. Since our baseline model does not implement any form of a copy mechanism, it fails on in- stances with out-of-vocabulary terms, such as the values of the SPECIFIER slot in the test set. These, in fact, account for almost half of the errors indi- cated by the SER metric in Table 4. Therefore, more robust models have good potential for im- proving on our scores. 4 Discussion In Table 6 we demonstrate how the 9 DAs of the ViGGO dataset can support a natural multi-turn exchange on the topic of video games, as a part of a longer casual conversation on different top- ics.",
      "4 Discussion In Table 6 we demonstrate how the 9 DAs of the ViGGO dataset can support a natural multi-turn exchange on the topic of video games, as a part of a longer casual conversation on different top- ics. One caveat of using a language generator trained on this dataset in a dialogue system as- is is that multiple subsequent turns discussing the same video game would be repeating its full name. ViGGO was designed for grounded generation but without context, and therefore it is up to the di- alogue manager to ensure that pronouns are sub- stituted for the names whenever it would sound more natural in a dialogue. Alternately, the dataset can easily be augmented with automatically con- structed samples which omit the NAME slot in the MR and replace the name with a pronoun in the reference utterance. 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented a new parallel cor- pus for data-to-text NLG, which contains 9 di- alogue acts, making it more conversational than other similar datasets.",

Numeric \u2013 value is a number or contains number(s) as the salient part (e.g., RE- LEASE YEAR or EXP RELEASE DATE), 3. Scalar \u2013 values are on a distinct scale (e.g., RATING or ESRB), 4. Categorical \u2013 takes on virtually any value, typically coming from a certain category, such as names or types (e.g., NAME or DE- VELOPER), 5.

      "Note that in ViGGO the items in the value of a List slot are comma-separated, and therefore the indi- vidual items must not contain a comma. There are no restrictions as to whether the values are single- word or multi-word in any of the categories. A.3 Data Collection When generating the MRs for the inform DA, we \ufb01xed the slot ratios: the NAME and GEN- RES slots were mandatory in every MR, the PLAYER PERSPECTIVE and RELEASE YEAR were enforced in about half of the MRs, while the re- maining slots are present in about 25% of the MRs. At the same time we imposed two con- straints on the slot combinations: (1) whenever one of the Steam, Linux or Mac related boolean slots is present in an MR, the PLATFORMS slot must be included too, and (2) whenever either of the Linux or Mac slots was picked for an MR, the other one was automatically added too. These two constraints were introduced so as to encour- age reference utterances with natural aggregations and contrast relations.",
      "These two constraints were introduced so as to encour- age reference utterances with natural aggregations and contrast relations. The remaining 8 DAs, however, contain signi\ufb01- cantly fewer slots each (see Table 2). We therefore decided to have the MTurk workers select 5 unique slot combinations for each given video game be- fore writing the corresponding utterances. Since for these DAs we collected less data, we tried to ensure in this way that we have a suf\ufb01cient num- ber of samples for those slot combinations that are most natural to be mentioned in each of the DAs. While \ufb01xing mandatory slots for each DA, we in- structed the workers to choose 1 or 2 additional slots depending on the task. The data collection for MRs with only 1 additional slot and for those with 2 was performed separately, so as to prevent workers from taking the easy way out by always selecting just a single slot, given the option. Leaving the slot selection to crowdworkers yields a frequency distribution of all slot combi- nations, which presumably indicates the suitability of different slots to be mentioned together in a sen- tence.",
      "Leaving the slot selection to crowdworkers yields a frequency distribution of all slot combi- nations, which presumably indicates the suitability of different slots to be mentioned together in a sen- tence. This meta-information can be made use of in a system\u2019s dialogue manager to sample from the observed slot combination distributions instead of sampling randomly or hard-coding the combina- tions.

These account for 53% of the selec- tions among the 6 DAs that can take 2 additional Figure 3: Distribution of the 8 most frequently selected slot combinations across different DAs. slots besides the mandatory ones. We can observe some interesting trends in the distributions, such as that the DEVELOPER + RELEASE YEAR com- bination was the most frequent one in the con\ufb01rm DA, while fairly rare in most of the other DAs.

A.4 Dataset Cleaning A large proportion of the raw data collected con- tained typos and various errors, as is inevitable when crowdsourcing. We took the following three steps to clean the data. First, we used regular expressions to enforce several standardization policies regarding special characters, punctuation, and the correction of undesired abbreviations/misspellings of standard domain-speci\ufb01c terms (e.g., we would change terms like \u201cPlay station\u201d or \u201cPS4\u201d to the uniform \u201cPlayStation\u201d). At the same time, we removed or enforced hyphens uniformly in certain terms, for example, \u201csingle-player\u201d. Although phrases such as \u201c\ufb01rst person\u201d should correctly have a hyphen when used as adjective, the turkers used this rule very inconsistently. In order to avoid model out- puts being penalized during the evaluation by the arbitrary choice of a hyphen presence or absence in the reference utterances, we decided to remove the hyphen in all such phrases regardless of the noun/adjective use.",
      "In order to avoid model out- puts being penalized during the evaluation by the arbitrary choice of a hyphen presence or absence in the reference utterances, we decided to remove the hyphen in all such phrases regardless of the noun/adjective use. Second, we developed an extensive set of heuristics to identify slot-related errors. This pro- cess revealed the vast majority of missing or incor- rect slot mentions, which we subsequently \ufb01xed according to the corresponding MRs. Turkers would sometimes also inject a piece of informa- tion which was not present in the MR, some of",
      "which is not even represented by any of the slots, e.g., plot or main characters. We remove this ex- traneous information from the utterances so as to avoid confusing the neural model. This step thus involved certain manual work and was thus per- formed jointly with the third step. Finally, we further resolved the remaining ty- pos, grammatical errors, and unsolicited informa- tion. A.5 Model Parameters Even though on the small datasets we work with we do not necessarily expect the Transformer model to perform better than recurrent neural networks, we chose this model for its signi\ufb01- cantly faster training, without sacri\ufb01cing the per- formance. For our experiments a small 2-layer Transformer with 8 heads proved to be suf\ufb01cient. The input tokens are encoded into embeddings of size 256, and the target sequences were truncated to 60 tokens. The model performed best with dropout values of 0.2. For training of the Trans- former models we used the Adam optimizer with a custom learning rate schedule including a brief linear warm-up and a cosine decay."
