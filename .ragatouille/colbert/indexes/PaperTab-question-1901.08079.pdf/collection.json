  "A QUESTION-ENTAILMENT APPROACH TO QUESTION ANSWERING A PREPRINT Asma Ben Abacha Dina Demner-Fushman benabachaa@nih.gov ddemner@mail.nih.gov Lister Hill Center, U.S. National Library of Medicine, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD February 7, 2022 ABSTRACT One of the challenges in large-scale information retrieval (IR) is to develop \ufb01ne-grained and domain- speci\ufb01c methods to answer natural language questions. Despite the availability of numerous sources and datasets for answer retrieval, Question Answering (QA) remains a challenging problem due to the dif\ufb01culty of the question understanding and answer extraction tasks. One of the promising tracks investigated in QA is to map new questions to formerly answered questions that are \u201csimilar\u201d. In this paper, we propose a novel QA approach based on Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) and we describe the QA system and resources that we built and evaluated on real medical questions. First, we compare machine learning and deep learning methods for RQE using different kinds of datasets, including textual inference, question similarity and entailment in both the open and clinical domains.",
  "First, we compare machine learning and deep learning methods for RQE using different kinds of datasets, including textual inference, question similarity and entailment in both the open and clinical domains. Second, we combine IR models with the best RQE method to select entailed questions and rank the retrieved answers. To study the end-to-end QA approach, we built the MedQuAD collection of 47,457 question-answer pairs from trusted medical sources, that we introduce and share in the scope of this paper. Following the evaluation process used in TREC 2017 LiveQA, we \ufb01nd that our approach exceeds the best results of the medical task with a 29.8% increase over the best of\ufb01cial score. The evaluation results also support the relevance of question entailment for QA and highlight the effectiveness of combining IR and RQE for future QA efforts. Our \ufb01ndings also show that relying on a restricted set of reliable answer sources can bring a substantial improvement in medical QA.",

However, ef\ufb01ciency through personalization is not yet the most suitable model when tackling domain-speci\ufb01c searches. This is due to several factors, such as the lexical and semantic challenges of domain-speci\ufb01c data that often include advanced argumentation and complex contextual information, the higher sparseness of relevant information sources, and the more pronounced lack of similarities between users\u2019 searches.",
  "This is due to several factors, such as the lexical and semantic challenges of domain-speci\ufb01c data that often include advanced argumentation and complex contextual information, the higher sparseness of relevant information sources, and the more pronounced lack of similarities between users\u2019 searches. A recent study on expert search strategies among healthcare information professionals [44] showed that, for a given search task, they spend an average of 60 minutes per collection or database, 3 minutes to examine the relevance of each document, and 4 hours of total search time. When written in steps, their search strategy spans over 15 lines and can reach up to 105 lines. With the abundance of information sources in the medical domain, consumers are more and more faced with a similar challenge, one that needs dedicated solutions that can adapt to the heterogeneity and speci\ufb01cs of health-related information. arXiv:1901.08079v1  [cs.CL]  23 Jan 2019",
  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 Dedicated Question Answering (QA) systems are one of the viable solutions to this problem as they are designed to understand natural language questions without relying on external information on the users. In the context of QA, the goal of Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) is to retrieve answers to a premise question (PQ) by retrieving inferred or entailed questions, called hypothesis questions (HQ) that already have associated answers. Therefore, we de\ufb01ne the entailment relation between two questions as: a question A entails a question B if every answer to B is also a correct answer to A [4]. RQE is particularly relevant due to the increasing numbers of similar questions posted online [32] and its ability to solve differently the challenging issues of question understanding and answer extraction. In addition to being used to \ufb01nd relevant answers, these resources can also be used in training models able to recognize inference relations and similarity between questions.",
  "In addition to being used to \ufb01nd relevant answers, these resources can also be used in training models able to recognize inference relations and similarity between questions. Question similarity has recently attracted international challenges [35, 36] and several research efforts proposing a wide range of approaches, including Logistic Regression, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory cells (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [17, 43, 4, 30]. In this paper, we study question entailment in the medical domain and the effectiveness of the end-to-end RQE-based QA approach by evaluating the relevance of the retrieved answers. Although entailment was attempted in QA before [22, 38, 10], as far as we know, we are the \ufb01rst to introduce and evaluate a full medical question answering approach based on question entailment for free-text questions. Our contributions are: 1. A study of machine learning and deep learning approaches to RQE using different kinds of datasets, including textual inference, question similarity and entailment in both the open and clinical domains. 2.",

Section 4 describes the new collection of medical question-answer pairs. In Section 5, we describe our RQE-based approach for QA. Section 6 presents our evaluation of the retrieved answers and the results obtained on TREC 2017 LiveQA medical questions. 2 Background In this section we de\ufb01ne the RQE task and describe related work at the intersection of question answering, question similarity and textual inference. 2.1 Task De\ufb01nition The de\ufb01nition of Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) can have a signi\ufb01cant impact on QA results. In related work, the meaning associated with Natural Language Inference (NLI) varies among different tasks and events. For instance, Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) was addressed by the PASCAL challenge [13], where the entailment relation has been assessed manually by human judges who selected relevant sentences \"entailing\" a set of hypotheses from a list of documents returned by different Information Retrieval (IR) methods.",
  "In another de\ufb01nition, the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus SNLI [8], used three classi\ufb01cation labels for the relations between two sentences: entailment, neutral and contradiction. For the entailment label, the annotators who built the corpus were presented with an image and asked to write a caption \u201cthat is a de\ufb01nitely true description of the photo\u201d. For the neutral label, they were asked to provide a caption \u201cthat might be a true description of the label\u201d. They were asked for a caption that \u201cis de\ufb01nitely a false description of the photo\u201d for the contradiction label. More recently, the multiNLI corpus [51] was shared in the scope of the RepEval 2017 shared task2 [37]. To build the corpus, annotators were presented with a premise text and asked to write three sentences. One novel sentence, which is 1https://github.com/abachaa/MedQuAD 2https://repeval2017.github.io/shared 2",
  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 \u201cnecessarily true or appropriate in the same situations as the premise,\u201d for the entailment label, a sentence, which is \u201cnecessarily false or inappropriate whenever the premise is true,\u201d for the contradiction label, and a last sentence, \u201cwhere neither condition applies,\u201d for the neutral label. Whereas these NLI de\ufb01nitions might be suitable for the broad topic of text understanding, their relation to practical information retrieval or question answering systems is not straightforward. In contrast, RQE has to be tailored to the question answering task. For instance, if the premise question is \"looking for cold medications for a 30 yo woman\", a RQE approach should be able to consider the more general (less restricted) question \"looking for cold medications\" as relevant, since its answers are relevant for the initial question, whereas \"looking for medications for a 30 yo woman\" is a useless contextualization. The entailment relation we are seeking in the QA context should include relevant and meaningful relaxations of contextual and semantic constraints (cf. Section 3.1).",
  "The entailment relation we are seeking in the QA context should include relevant and meaningful relaxations of contextual and semantic constraints (cf. Section 3.1). 2.2 Related Work on Question Answering Classical QA systems face two main challenges related to question analysis and answer extraction. Several QA approaches were proposed in the literature for the open domain [14, 23] and the medical domain [3, 6, 52]. A variety of methods were developed for question analysis, focus (topic) recognition and question type identi\ufb01cation [29, 5, 34, 33]. Similarly, many different approaches tackled document or passage retrieval and answer selection and (re)ranking [50, 46, 47]. An alternative approach consists in \ufb01nding similar questions or FAQs that are already answered [25, 49]. One of the earliest question answering systems based on \ufb01nding similar questions and re-using the existing answers was FAQ FINDER [9]. Another system that complements the existing Q&A services of NetWellness3 is SimQ [32], which allows retrieval of similar web-based consumer health questions.",

Another system that complements the existing Q&A services of NetWellness3 is SimQ [32], which allows retrieval of similar web-based consumer health questions. SimQ uses syntactic and semantic features to compute similarity between questions, and UMLS [31] as a standardized semantic knowledge source. The system achieves 72.2% precision, 78.0% recall and 75.0% F-score on NetWellness questions. However, the method was evaluated only on one question similarity dataset, and the retrieved answers were not evaluated. The aim of the medical task at TREC 2017 LiveQA was to develop techniques for answering complex questions such as consumer health questions, as well as to identify relevant answer sources that can comply with the sensitivity of medical information retrieval. The CMU-OAQA system [48] achieved the best performance of 0.637 average score on the medical task by using an attentional encoder-decoder model for paraphrase identi\ufb01cation and answer ranking. The Quora question-similarity dataset was used for training.",

The Quora question-similarity dataset was used for training. The PRNA system [15] achieved the second best performance in the medical task with 0.49 average score using Wikipedia as the \ufb01rst answer source and Yahoo and Google searches as secondary answer sources. Each medical question was decomposed into several subquestions. To extract the answer from the selected text passage, a bi-directional attention model trained on the SQUAD dataset was used. Deep neural network models have been pushing the limits of performance achieved in QA related tasks using large training datasets. The results obtained by CMU-OAQA and PRNA showed that large open-domain datasets were bene\ufb01cial for the medical domain. However, the best system (CMU-OAQA) relying on the same training data obtained a score of 1.139 on the LiveQA open-domain task.",

However, the best system (CMU-OAQA) relying on the same training data obtained a score of 1.139 on the LiveQA open-domain task. While this gap in performance can be explained in part by the discrepancies between the medical test questions and the open-domain questions, it also highlights the need for larger medical datasets to support deep learning approaches in dealing with the linguistic complexity of consumer health questions and the challenge of \ufb01nding correct and complete answers. Another technique was used by ECNU-ICA team [2] based on learning question similarity via two long short-term memory (LSTM) networks applied to obtain the semantic representations of the questions. To construct a collection of similar question pairs, they searched community question answering sites such as Yahoo! and Answers.com. In contrast, the ECNU-ICA system achieved the best performance of 1.895 in the open-domain task but an average score of only 0.402 in the medical task.",

In contrast, the ECNU-ICA system achieved the best performance of 1.895 in the open-domain task but an average score of only 0.402 in the medical task. As the ECNU-ICA approach also relied on a neural network for question matching, this result shows that training attention-based decoder-encoder networks on the Quora dataset generalized better to the medical domain than training LSTMs on similar questions from Yahoo! and Answers.com. The CMU-LiveMedQA team [52] designed a speci\ufb01c system for the medical task. Using only the provided training datasets and the assumption that each question contains only one focus, the CMU-LiveMedQA system obtained an average score of 0.353. They used a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify a question into a restricted 3http://netwellness.org/ 3",
  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 set of 10 question types and crawled \"relevant\" online web pages to \ufb01nd the answers. However, the results were lower than those achieved by the systems relying on \ufb01nding similar answered questions. These results support the relevance of similar question matching for the end-to-end QA task as a new way of approaching QA instead of the classical QA approaches based on Question Analysis and Answer Retrieval. 2.3 Related Work on Question Similarity and Entailment Several efforts focused on recognizing similar questions. Jeon et al. [24] showed that a retrieval model based on translation probabilities learned from a question and answer archive can recognize semantically similar questions. Duan et al. [18] proposed a dedicated language modeling approach for question search, using question topic (user\u2019s interest) and question focus (certain aspect of the topic). Lately, these efforts were supported by a task on Question-Question similarity introduced in the community QA challenge at SemEval (task 3B) [35].",
  "Lately, these efforts were supported by a task on Question-Question similarity introduced in the community QA challenge at SemEval (task 3B) [35]. Given a new question, the task focused on reranking all similar questions retrieved by a search engine, assuming that the answers to the similar questions will be correct answers for the new question. Different machine learning and deep learning approaches were tested in the scope of SemEval 2016 [35] and 2017 [36] task 3B. The best performing system in 2017 achieved a MAP of 47.22% using supervised Logistic Regression that combined different unsupervised similarity measures such as Cosine and Soft-Cosine [11]. The second best system achieved 46.93% MAP with a learning-to-rank method using Logistic Regression and a rich set of features including lexical and semantic features as well as embeddings generated by different neural networks (siamese, Bi-LSTM, GRU and CNNs) [21]. In the scope of this challenge, a dataset was collected from Qatar Living forum for training. We refer to this dataset as SemEval-cQA4.",
  "In the scope of this challenge, a dataset was collected from Qatar Living forum for training. We refer to this dataset as SemEval-cQA4. In another effort, an answer-based de\ufb01nition of RQE was proposed and tested [4]. The authors introduced a dataset of clinical questions and used a feature-based method that provided an Accuracy of 75% on consumer health questions. We will call this dataset Clinical-QE5. Dos Santos et al. [17] proposed a new approach to retrieve semantically equivalent questions combining a bag-of-words representation with a distributed vector representation created by a CNN and user data collected from two Stack Exchange communities. Lei et al. [30] proposed a recurrent and convolutional model (gated convolution) to map questions to their semantic representations. The models were pre-trained within an encoder-decoder framework.",
  "Lei et al. [30] proposed a recurrent and convolutional model (gated convolution) to map questions to their semantic representations. The models were pre-trained within an encoder-decoder framework. 3 RQE Approaches and Experiments The choice of two methods for our empirical study is motivated by the best performance achieved by Logistic Regression in question-question similarity at SemEval 2017 (best system [11] and second best system [21]), and the high performance achieved by neural networks on larger datasets such as SNLI [8, 28, 12, 20]. We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the RQE task, then present the two approaches, and evaluate their performance on \ufb01ve different datasets. 3.1 De\ufb01nition In the context of QA, the goal of RQE is to retrieve answers to a new question by retrieving entailed questions with associated answers.",
  "3.1 De\ufb01nition In the context of QA, the goal of RQE is to retrieve answers to a new question by retrieving entailed questions with associated answers. We therefore de\ufb01ne question entailment as: \u2022 a question A entails a question B if every answer to B is also a complete or partial answer to A. We present below two examples of consumer health questions Ai and entailed questions Bi: Example 1 (each answer to the entailed question B1 is a complete answer to A1): \u2022 A1: What is the latest news on tennitis, or ringing in the ear, I am 75 years old and have had ringing in the ear since my mid 5os. Thank you. \u2022 B1: What is the latest research on Tinnitus? Example 2 (each answer to the entailed question B2 is a partial answer to A2): \u2022 A2: My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, my father is not of the greatest health either and is the main caregiver for my mother.",

  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 \u2022 B2: What resources are available for Alzheimer\u2019s caregivers? The inclusion of partial answers in the de\ufb01nition of question entailment also allows ef\ufb01cient relaxation of the contextual constraints of the original question A to retrieve relevant answers from entailed, but less restricted, questions. 3.2 Deep Learning Model To recognize entailment between two questions PQ (premise) and HQ (hypothesis), we adapted the neural network proposed by Bowman et al. [8]. Our DL model, presented in Figure 1, consists of three 600d ReLU layers, with a bottom layer taking the concatenated sentence representations as input and a top layer feeding a softmax classi\ufb01er. The sentence embedding model sums the Recurrent neural network (RNN) embeddings of its words. The word embeddings are \ufb01rst initialized with pretrained GloVe vectors. This adaptation provided the best performance in previous experiments with RQE data.

Figure 1: Neural Network Architecture GloVe6 is an unsupervised learning algorithm to generate vector representations for words [40]. Training is performed on aggregated word co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus, and the resulting representations show interesting linear substructures of the word vector space. We use the pretrained common crawl version with 840B tokens and 300d vectors, which are not updated during training. 3.3 Logistic Regression Classi\ufb01er In this feature-based approach, we use Logistic Regression to classify question pairs into entailment or no-entailment. Logistic Regression achieved good results on this speci\ufb01c task and outperformed other statistical learning algorithms such as SVM and Naive Bayes. In a preprocessing step, we remove stop words and perform word stemming using the Porter algorithm [41] for all (PQ,HQ) pairs. We use a list of nine features, selected after several experiments on RTE datasets [13]. We compute \ufb01ve similarity measures between the pre-processed questions and use their values as features.",

We use Word Overlap, the Dice coef\ufb01cient based on the number of common bigrams, Cosine, Levenshtein, and the Jaccard similarities. Our feature list also includes the maximum and average values obtained with these measures and the question length ratio (length(PQ)/length(HQ)). We compute a morphosyntactic feature indicating the number of common nouns and verbs between PQ and HQ. TreeTagger [45] was used for POS tagging. For RQE, we add an additional feature speci\ufb01c to the question type. We use a dictionary lookup to map triggers to the question type (e.g. Treatment, Prognosis, Inheritance). Triggers are identi\ufb01ed for each question type based on a manual annotation of a set of medical questions (cf. Section 4.2).",

The Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus (SNLI) [8] contains 569,037 sentence pairs written by humans based on image captioning. The training set of the MultiNLI corpus [51] consists of 393,000 pairs of sentences from \ufb01ve genres of written and spoken English (e.g. Travel, Government). Two other \"matched\" and \"mismatched\" sets are also available for development (20,000 pairs).

We converted the contradiction and neutral labels to the same non-entailment class. The QUORA dataset of similar questions was recently published with 404,279 question pairs.",

The CHQ dataset consists of 1,721 consumer information requests manually annotated with subquestions, each identi\ufb01ed by a question type and a focus. First, we selected automatically harvested FAQs, from U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) websites, that share both the same focus and the same question type with the CHQs. As FAQs are most often very short, we \ufb01rst assume that the CHQ entails the FAQ. Two sets of pairs were constructed: (i) positive pairs of CHQs and FAQs sharing at least one common question type and the question focus, and (ii) negative pairs corresponding to a focus mismatch or type mismatch. For each category of negative examples, we randomly selected the same number of pairs for a balanced dataset.",
  "For each category of negative examples, we randomly selected the same number of pairs for a balanced dataset.

Logistic Regression achieved the best Accuracy of 98.60% on Clinical-RQE. We also performed a 10-fold cross-validation on the full Clinical-QE data of 8,588 question pairs, which gave 98.61% Accuracy.

We followed a similar approach for this evaluation by combining the LR method with the IR baseline provided in the context of SemEval-cQA. The hybrid method combines the score provided by the Logistic Regression model and the reciprocal rank from the IR baseline using a weight-based combination: 6",

  "data. This could be explained by the different types of data leading to wrong internal conceptualizations of medical terms and questions in the deep neural layers. This performance drop could also be caused by the complexity of the test consumer health questions that are often composed of several subquestions, contain contextual information, and may contain misspellings and ungrammatical sentences, which makes them more dif\ufb01cult to process [42]. Another aspect is the semantics of the task as discussed in Section 2.1. The de\ufb01nition of textual entailment in open-domain may not quite apply to question entailment due to the strict semantics. Also the general textual entailment de\ufb01nitions refer only to the premise and hypothesis, while the de\ufb01nition of RQE for question answering relies on the relationship between the sets of answers of the compared questions. 4 Building a Medical QA Collection from Trusted Resources A RQE-based QA system requires a collection of question-answer pairs to map new user questions to the existing questions with an RQE approach, rank the retrieved questions, and present their answers to the user.",

  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 5 The Proposed Entailment-based QA System Our goal is to generate a ranked list of answers for a given Premise Question PQ by ranking the recognized Hypothesis Questions HQs.

Therefore, we \ufb01rst \ufb01lter the questions with an IR method to retrieve candidate questions, then classify them as entailed (or not) by the user/test question. Based on the positive results of the combination method tested on SemEval-cQA data (Section 3.5), we adopted a combination method to merge the results obtained by the search engine and the RQE scores. The answers are then combined from both methods and ranked using an aggregate score. Figure 4 presents the overall architecture of the proposed QA system.

Figure 4: Overview of the RQE-based Question Answering System. 5.2 Finding Similar Question Candidates For each premise question PQ, we use the Terrier search engine22 to retrieve N relevant question candidates {HQj, j \u2208 [1, N]} and then apply the RQE classi\ufb01er to predict the labels for the pairs (PQ,HQj). We indexed the questions of our QA collection without the associated answers. In order to improve the indexing and the performance of question retrieval, we also indexed the synonyms of the question focus and the triggers of the question type with each question. This choice allowed us to avoid the shortcomings of query expansion, including incorrect or irrelevant synonyms and the increased execution time. The synonyms of the question focus (topic) were extracted automatically from the QA collection. The triggers of each question type were de\ufb01ned manually in the question types taxonomy.

  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 The IR task consists of retrieving hypothesis questions HQj relevant to the submitted question PQ. As fusion of IR result has shown good performance in different tracks in TREC, we merge the results of the TF-IDF weighting function and the In-expB2 DFR model [39]. Let QLV = HQV 1 , HQV 2 , ..., HQV N be the set of N questions retrieved by the \ufb01rst IR model V and QLW = HQW 1 , HQW 2 , ..., HQW N be the set of N questions retrieved by the second IR model W. We merge both sets by summing the scores of each retrieved question HQj in both QLV and QLW lists, then we re-rank the hypothesis questions HQj. 5.3 Combining IR and RQE Methods The IR models and the RQE Logistic Regression model bring different perspectives to the search for relevant candidate questions. In particular, question entailment allows understanding the relations between the important terms, whereas the traditional IR methods identify the important terms, but will not notice if the relations are opposite.",
  "In particular, question entailment allows understanding the relations between the important terms, whereas the traditional IR methods identify the important terms, but will not notice if the relations are opposite. Moreover, some of the question types that the RQE classi\ufb01er learns will not be deemed important terms by traditional IR and the most relevant questions will not be ranked at the top of the list. Therefore, in our approach, when a question is submitted to the system, candidate questions are fetched using the IR models, then the RQE classi\ufb01er is applied to \ufb01lter out the non-entailed questions and re-rank the remaining candidates. Speci\ufb01cally, we denote CL the list of question candidates {HQj, 1 \u2264j \u2264N} returned by the IR system. The premise question PQ is then used to construct N question pairs {(PQ, HQj), 1 \u2264j \u2264N}.

The latter observation, (b), makes the hybrid IR+RQE approach even more promising as it gives it a large potential for the improvement of answer completeness.",
  "(b) Our system answered one subquestion at most when many LiveQA test questions had several subquestions. The latter observation, (b), makes the hybrid IR+RQE approach even more promising as it gives it a large potential for the improvement of answer completeness. The former observation, (a), provides another interesting insight: restricting the answer source to only reliable collections can actually improve the QA performance without losing coverage (i.e., our QA approach provided at least one answer to each test question and obtained the best relevance score). In another observation, the assessors reported that many of the returned answers had a correct question type but a wrong focus, which indicates that including a focus recognition module to \ufb01lter such wrong answers can improve further the QA performance in terms of precision. Another aspect that was reported is the repetition of the same (or similar) answer from different websites, which could be addressed by improving answer selection with inter-answer comparisons and removal of near-duplicates. Also, half of the LiveQA test questions are about Drugs, when only two of our resources are specialized in Drugs, among 12 sub-collections overall. Accordingly, the assessors noticed that the performance 16",
  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 of the QA systems was better on questions about diseases than on questions about drugs, which suggests a need for extending our medical QA collection with more information about drugs and associated question types. We also looked closely at the private websites used by the LiveQA-Med annotators to provide some of the reference answers for the test questions. For instance, the ConsumerLab website was useful to answer a question about the ingredients of a Drug (COENZYME Q10). Similarly, the eHealthMe website was used to answer a test question asking about interactions between two drugs (Phentermine and Dicyclomine) when no information was found in DailyMed. eHealthMe provides healthcare big data analysis and private research and studies including self-reported adverse drug effects by patients. But the question remains on the extent to which such big data and other private websites could be used to automatically answer medical questions if information is otherwise unavailable. Unlike medical professionals, patients do not necessarily have the knowledge and tools to validate such information. An alternative approach could be to put limitations on medical QA systems in terms of the questions that can be answered (e.g.",
  "Unlike medical professionals, patients do not necessarily have the knowledge and tools to validate such information. An alternative approach could be to put limitations on medical QA systems in terms of the questions that can be answered (e.g. \"What is my diagnosis for such symptoms\") and build classi\ufb01ers to detect such questions and warn the users about the dangers of looking for their answers online. More generally, medical QA systems should follow some strict guidelines regarding the goal and background knowledge and resources of each system in order to protect the consumers from misleading or harmful information. Such guidelines could be based (i) on the source of the information such as health and medical information websites sponsored by the U.S. government, not-for-pro\ufb01t health or medical organizations, and medical university centers, or (ii) on conventions such as the code of conduct of the HON Foundation (HONcode) that addresses the reliability and usefulness of medical information on the Internet. Our experiments show that limiting the number of answer sources with such guidelines is not only feasible, but it could also enhance the performance of the QA system from an information retrieval perspective.",
  "Our experiments show that limiting the number of answer sources with such guidelines is not only feasible, but it could also enhance the performance of the QA system from an information retrieval perspective. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we carried out an empirical study of machine learning and deep learning methods for Recognizing Question Entailment in the medical domain using several datasets. We developed a RQE-based QA system to answer new medical questions using existing question-answer pairs. We built and shared a collection of 47K medical question- answer pairs24. Our QA approach outperformed the best results on TREC-2017 LiveQA medical test questions. The proposed approach can be applied and adapted to open-domain as well as speci\ufb01c-domain QA. Deep learning models achieved interesting results on open-domain and clinical datasets, but obtained a lower performance on consumer health questions. We will continue investigating other network architectures including transfer learning, as well as creation of a large collection of consumer health questions for training to improve the performance of DL models. Future work also includes exploring integration of a Question Focus Recognition module to enhance candidate question retrieval, and expanding our question-answer collection.",

(Also called: Hernia - diaphragmatic; Congenital hernia of the diaphragm (CDH)) ANSWER: A diaphragmatic hernia is a rare defect. It occurs while the baby is developing in the womb. Because the diaphragm is not fully developed, organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, spleen, part of the 25https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001135.htm 18",
  "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 7, 2022 liver, and the kidney, may take up part of the chest cavity. CDH most often involves only one side of the diaphragm. It is more common on the left side. Often, the lung tissue and blood vessels in the area do not develop normally either. It is not clear if the diaphragmatic hernia causes the underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels, or the other way around. 40% of babies with this condition have other problems as well. Having a parent or sibling with the condition increases the risk. C) Our IR+RQE QA System: 1. Answer S2-1 (from GHR26): What are the genetic changes related to congenital diaphragmatic hernia ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect) ANSWER: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome.",
  "(Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect) ANSWER: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the speci\ufb01c mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear.",
  "In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the speci\ufb01c mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that in\ufb02uence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identi\ufb01ed. 2.",
  "Environmental factors that in\ufb02uence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identi\ufb01ed. 2. Answer S2-2 (from GHR): Is congenital diaphragmatic hernia inherited ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect): Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition. 3. Answer S2-3 (from MedlinePlus27) What is the outlook for Diaphragmatic hernia ? (Also called: Hernia - diaphragmatic; Congenital hernia of the diaphragm (CDH)): The outcome of surgery depends on how well the baby\u2019s lungs have developed. It also depends on whether there are any other congenital problems. Most often the outlook is good for infants who have a suf\ufb01cient amount of working lung tissue and have no other problems.",
