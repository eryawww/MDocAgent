            "NLI-PT includes the origi- nal student text and four different types of an- notation: POS, \ufb01ne-grained POS, constituency parses, and dependency parses. NLI-PT can be used not only in NLI but also in research on several topics in the \ufb01eld of Second Lan- guage Acquisition and educational NLP. We discuss possible applications of this dataset and present the results obtained for the \ufb01rst lexical baseline system for Portuguese NLI. 1 Introduction Several learner corpora have been compiled for English, such as the International Corpus of Learner English (Granger, 2003). The importance of such resources has been increasingly recog- nized across a variety of research areas, from Sec- ond Language Acquisition to Natural Language Processing. Recently, we have seen substantial growth in this area and new corpora for languages other than English have appeared. For Romance languages, there are a several corpora and re- sources for French1, Spanish (Lozano, 2010), and Italian (Boyd et al., 2014). Portuguese has also received attention in the compilation of learner corpora.",

Finally, the Corpus de Aquisic\u00b8\u02dcao de L2, CAL25, compiled at the New University of Lisbon, contains 1,380 texts and 281,301 words, and it includes texts produced by adults and children, as well as a spoken subset. The aforementioned Portuguese learner corpora contain very useful data for research, particularly for Native Language Identi\ufb01cation (NLI), a task that has received much attention in recent years. NLI is the task of determining the native language (L1) of an author based on their second language (L2) linguistic productions (Malmasi and Dras, 2017). NLI works by identifying language use patterns that are common to groups of speakers of the same native language. This process is un- derpinned by the presupposition that an author\u2019s L1 disposes them towards certain language pro- duction patterns in their L2, as in\ufb02uenced by their mother tongue.",

A major motivation for NLI is studying second language acquisition. NLI mod- els can enable analysis of inter-L1 linguistic dif- ferences, allowing us to study the language learn- ing process and develop L1-speci\ufb01c pedagogical methods and materials. However, there are limitations to using exist- ing Portuguese data for NLI. An important issue is that the different corpora each contain data col- 2http:\/\/www.clul.ulisboa.pt\/pt\/24-recursos\/350-recolha- de-dados-de-ple 3http:\/\/alfclul.clul.ul.pt\/teitok\/learnercorpus 4http:\/\/teitok.iltec.pt\/peapl2\/ 5http:\/\/cal2.clunl.edu.pt\/ arXiv:1804.11346v1  [cs.CL]  30 Apr 2018",
            "lected from different L1 backgrounds in varying amounts; they would need to be combined to have suf\ufb01cient data for an NLI study. Another chal- lenge concerns the annotations as only two of the corpora (PEAPL2 and COPLE2) are linguistically annotated, and this is limited to POS tags. The dif- ferent data formats used by each corpus presents yet another challenge to their usage. In this paper we present NLI-PT, a dataset col- lected for Portuguese NLI. The dataset is made freely available for research purposes.6 With the goal of unifying learner data collected from var- ious sources, listed in Section 3.1, we applied a methodology which has been previously used for the compilation of language variety corpora (Tan et al., 2014). The data was converted to a uni- \ufb01ed data format and uniformly annotated at dif- ferent linguistic levels as described in Section 3.2. To the best of our knowledge, NLI-PT is the only Portuguese dataset developed speci\ufb01cally for NLI, this will open avenues for research in this area.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, NLI-PT is the only Portuguese dataset developed speci\ufb01cally for NLI, this will open avenues for research in this area. 2 Related Work NLI has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Due to the availability of suitable data, as dis- cussed earlier, this attention has been particularly focused on English. The most notable examples are the two editions of the NLI shared task or- ganized in 2013 (Tetreault et al., 2013) and 2017 (Malmasi et al., 2017). Even though most NLI research has been car- ried out on English data, an important research trend in recent years has been the application of NLI methods to other languages, as discussed in Malmasi and Dras (2015). Recent NLI studies on languages other than English include Arabic (Mal- masi and Dras, 2014a) and Chinese (Malmasi and Dras, 2014b; Wang et al., 2015).",
            "Recent NLI studies on languages other than English include Arabic (Mal- masi and Dras, 2014a) and Chinese (Malmasi and Dras, 2014b; Wang et al., 2015). To the best of our knowledge, no study has been published on Por- tuguese and the NLI-PT dataset opens new possi- bilities of research for Portuguese. In Section 4.1 we present the \ufb01rst simple baseline results for this task. Finally, as NLI-PT can be used in other applica- tions besides NLI, it is important to point out that a number of studies have been published on educa- tional NLP applications for Portuguese and on the 6NLI-PT is available at: http:\/\/www.clul.ulisboa.pt\/en\/resources-en\/11- resources\/894-nli-pt-a-portuguese-native-language- identi\ufb01cation-dataset compilation of learner language resources for Por- tuguese.",
            "Examples of such studies include gram- matical error correction (Martins et al., 1998), au- tomated essay scoring (Elliot, 2003), academic word lists (Baptista et al., 2010), and the learner corpora presented in the previous section. 3 Corpus Description 3.1 Collection methodology The data was collected from three different learner corpora of Portuguese: (i) COPLE2; (ii) Leiria corpus, and (iii) PEAPL27 as presented in Table 3.

In the dataset we included all the data in COPLE2 and sections of PEAPL2 and Leiria corpus. The main variable we used for text selection was the presence of speci\ufb01c L1s. Since the three corpora consider different L1s, we decided to use the L1s present in the largest corpus, COPLE2, as the reference. Therefore, we included in the dataset texts corresponding to the following 15 L1s: Chinese, English, Spanish, German, Russian, French, Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Tetum, Arabic, Polish, Korean, Romanian, and Swedish. It was the case that some of the L1s present in COPLE2 were not documented in the other corpora. The number of texts from each L1 is presented in Ta- ble 2. Concerning the corpus design, there is some variability among the sources we used. Leiria cor- pus and PEAPL2 followed a similar approach for data collection and show a close design.",

Three topics account for a 48.7% of the total texts and, on the other hand, a 72% of the topics are represented by 1- 10 texts (Figure 1). This variability affects also text length.

To better understand the distribution of texts in terms of word length we plot a histogram of all texts with their word length in bins of 10 (1-10 tokens, 11-20 tokens, 21-30 tokens and so on) (Figure 2). The three corpora use the pro\ufb01ciency levels de- \ufb01ned in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), but they show differences in the number of levels they consider.

As a second step, we proceeded to the linguistic annotation of the texts using different NLP tools. We annotated the dataset at two levels: Part of Speech (POS) and syntax. We performed the an- notation with freely available tools for the Por- tuguese language. For POS we added a sim- ple POS, that is, only type of word, and a \ufb01ne-",
            "grained POS, which is the type of word plus its morphological features. We used the LX Parser (Silva et al., 2010), for the simple POS and the Portuguese morphological module of Freeling (Padr\u00b4o and Stanilovsky, 2012), for detailed POS. Concerning syntactic annotations, we included constituency and dependency annotations. For constituency parsing, we used the LX Parser, and for dependency, the DepPattern toolkit (Otero and Gonz\u00b4alez, 2012). 4 Applications NLI-PT was developed primarily for NLI, but it can be used for other research purposes ranging from second language acquisition to educational NLP applications. Here are a few examples of ap- plications in which the dataset can be used: \u2022 Computer-aided Language Learning (CALL): CALL software has been de- veloped for Portuguese (Marujo et al., 2009). Further improvements in these tools can take advantage of the training material available in NLI-PT for a number of purposes such as L1-tailored exercise design.",
            "Further improvements in these tools can take advantage of the training material available in NLI-PT for a number of purposes such as L1-tailored exercise design. \u2022 Grammatical error detection and correction: as discussed in Zampieri and Tan (2014), a known challenge in this task is acquiring suit- able training data to account for the vari- ation of errors present in non-native texts. One of the strategies developed to cope with this problem is to generate arti\ufb01cial train- ing data (Felice and Yuan, 2014). Augment- ing training data using a suitable annotated dataset such as NLI-PT can improve the qual- ity of existing grammatical error correction systems for Portuguese. \u2022 Spellchecking: Studies have shown that general-purpose spell checkers target perfor- mance errors but fail to address many com- petence errors committed by language learn- ers (Rimrott and Heift, 2005). To address this shortcoming a number of spell checking tools have been developed for language learners (Ndiaye and Faltin, 2003). Suitable training data is required o develop these tools.",

Its annotation and the number of second lan- guages included in the dataset make NLI-PT a perfect \ufb01t for such studies. 4.1 A Baseline for Portuguese NLI To demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset we present the \ufb01rst lexical baseline for Portuguese NLI using a sub-set of NLI-PT.

            "To the best of our knowledge, no study has been published on Por- tuguese NLI and our work \ufb01lls this gap. In this experiment we included the \ufb01ve L1s in NLI-PT which contain the largest number of texts in this sub-set and run a simple linear SVM (Fan et al., 2008) classi\ufb01er using a bag of words model to identify the L1 of each text. The languages included in this experiment were Chinese (355 texts), English (236 texts), German (214 texts), Italian (216 texts), and Spanish (271 texts). We evaluated the model using strati\ufb01ed 10-fold cross-validation, achieving 70% accuracy. An im- portant limitation of this experiment is that it does not account for topic bias, an important issue in NLI (Malmasi, 2016). This is due to the fact that NLI-PT is not balanced by topic and the model could be learning topic associations instead.9 In future work we would like to carry out using syn- tactic features such as function words, syntactic relations and POS annotation.",

NLI-PT contains 1,868 texts written by speakers of 15 L1s amounting to over 380,000 tokens. As discussed in Section 4, NLI-PT opens sev- eral avenues for future research. It can be used for different research purposes beyond NLI such as grammatical error correction and CALL. An ex- periment with the texts written by the speakers of \ufb01ve L1s: Chinese, English, German, Italian, and Spanish using a bag of words model achieved 70% accuracy. We are currently experimenting with different features taking advantage of the annota- tion available in NLI-PT thus reducing topic bias in classi\ufb01cation. In future work we would like to include more texts in the dataset following the same methodol- ogy and annotation.",
