      "#MeToo on Campus: Studying College Sexual Assault at Scale using Data Reported on Social Media Viet Duong, Phu Pham, Ritwik Bose, Jiebo Luo Department of Computer Science University of Rochester {vduong, ppham2}@u.rochester.edu {rbose, jluo}@cs.rochester.edu Abstract Recently, the emergence of the #MeToo trend on so- cial media has empowered thousands of people to share their own sexual harassment experiences. This viral trend, in conjunction with the massive personal infor- mation and content available on Twitter, presents a promising opportunity to extract data-driven insights to complement the ongoing survey-based studies about sexual harassment in college. In this paper, we analyze the in\ufb02uence of the #MeToo trend on a pool of col- lege followers. The results show that the majority of topics embedded in those #MeToo tweets detail sexual harassment stories, and there exists a signi\ufb01cant cor- relation between the prevalence of this trend and of\ufb01- cial reports on several major geographical regions.",
      "The results show that the majority of topics embedded in those #MeToo tweets detail sexual harassment stories, and there exists a signi\ufb01cant cor- relation between the prevalence of this trend and of\ufb01- cial reports on several major geographical regions. Fur- thermore, we discover the outstanding sentiments of the #MeToo tweets using deep semantic meaning represen- tations and their implications on the affected users expe- riencing different types of sexual harassment. We hope this study can raise further awareness regarding sexual misconduct in academia. Introduction Sexual harassment is de\ufb01ned as \u201dbullying or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.\u201d 1 In fact, it is an on- going problem in the U.S., especially within the higher ed- ucation community. According to the National Sexual Vio- lence Resource Center (NSRVC), one in \ufb01ve women and one in sixteen men are sexually assaulted while they are attend- ing college.",
      "According to the National Sexual Vio- lence Resource Center (NSRVC), one in \ufb01ve women and one in sixteen men are sexually assaulted while they are attend- ing college. 2 In addition to the prevalence of campus sexual harassment, it has been shown to have detrimental effects on student\u2019s well-being, including health-related disorders and psychological distress (McDermut, Haaga, and Kirk 2000; Huerta et al. 2006). However, these studies on college sex- ual misconduct usually collect data based on questionnaires from a small sample of the college population, which might not be suf\ufb01ciently substantial to capture the big picture of sexual harassment risk of the entire student body.

On October 15 of 2017, prominent Hol- lywood actress Alyssa Milano, by accusing Oscar-winning \ufb01lm producer, Harvey Weinstein, for multiple sexual impro- priety attempts on herself and many other women in the \ufb01lm industry, ignited the \u201dMeToo\u201d trend on social media that called for women and men to share their own sexual harass- ment experience. According to CNN, over 1.7 million users had used the hash-tag in 85 countries. 3 Bene\ufb01ting from the tremendous amount of data supplied by this trend and the existing state-of-the-art semantic parser and generative sta- tistical models, we propose a new approach to characterizing sexual harassment by mining the tweets from college users with the hash-tag #metoo on Twitter.

      "Our main contributions are several folds. We investigate campus sexual harassment using a big-data approach by col- lecting data from Twitter. We employ traditional topic mod- eling and linear regression methods on a new dataset to high- light patterns of the ongoing troubling social behaviors at both institutional and individual levels. We propose a novel approach to combining domain-general deep semantic pars- ing and sentiment analysis to dissect personal narratives. Related Work Previous works for sexual misconduct in academia and workplace dated back to last few decades, when researchers studied the existence, as well as psychometric and demo- graphic insights regarding this social issue, based on survey and of\ufb01cial data (Fitzgerald et al. 1988; Fitzgerald, Gelfand, and Drasgow 1995; Timothy et al. 1982). However, these methods of gathering data are limited in scale and might be in\ufb02uenced by the psychological and cognitive tendencies of respondents not to provide faithful answers (Brutus, Agui- nis, and Wassmer 2013).",

However, these methods of gathering data are limited in scale and might be in\ufb02uenced by the psychological and cognitive tendencies of respondents not to provide faithful answers (Brutus, Agui- nis, and Wassmer 2013). The ubiquity of social media has motivated various re- search on widely-debated social topics such as gang vio- lence, hate code, or presidential election using Twitter data (Blandfort et al. 2019; ElSherief et al. 2018; Magu, Joshi, and Luo 2017; Wang et al. 2016). Recently, researchers have taken the earliest steps to understand sexual harassment us- ing textual data on Twitter. Using machine learning tech- 3http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/health/metoo- legacy/index.html arXiv:2001.05970v1  [cs.SI]  16 Jan 2020",
      "niques, Modrek and Chakalov (2019) built predictive mod- els for the identi\ufb01cation and categorization of lexical items pertaining to sexual abuse, while analysis on semantic con- tents remains untouched (Modrek and Chakalov 2019). De- spite the absence of Twitter data, Field et al. (2019) did a study more related to ours as they approach to the subject geared more towards linguistics tasks such as event, entity and sentiment analysis (Field, Bhat, and Tsvetkov 2019). Their work on event-entity extraction and contextual senti- ment analysis has provided many useful insights, which en- able us to tap into the potential of our Twitter dataset. There are several novelties in our approach to the #MeToo problem. Our target population is restricted to college fol- lowers on Twitter, with the goal to explore people\u2019s senti- ment towards the sexual harassment they experienced and its implication on the society\u2019s awareness and perception of the issue.",
      "There are several novelties in our approach to the #MeToo problem. Our target population is restricted to college fol- lowers on Twitter, with the goal to explore people\u2019s senti- ment towards the sexual harassment they experienced and its implication on the society\u2019s awareness and perception of the issue. Moreover, the focus on the sexual harassment re- ality in colleges calls for an analysis on the metadata of this demographics to reveal meaningful knowledge of their dis- tinctive characteristics (He, Murphy, and Luo 2016). Dataset Data Collection In this study, we limit the sample size to the followers identi- \ufb01ed as English speakers in the U.S. News Top 200 National Universities. We utilize the Jefferson-Henrique4 script, a web scraper designed for Twitter to retrieve a total of over 300,000 #MeToo tweets from October 15th, when Alyssa Milano posted the inceptive #MeToo tweet, to November 15th of 2017 to cover a period of a month when the trend was on the rise and attracting mass concerns.",
      "Since the lists of the followers of the studied colleges might overlap and many Twitter users tend to reiterate other\u2019s tweets, simply putting all the data collected together could create a major redundancy problem. We extract unique users and tweets from the combined result set to generate a dataset of about 60,000 unique tweets, pertaining to 51,104 unique users. Text Preprocessing We pre-process the Twitter textual data to ensure that its lex- ical items are to a high degree lexically comparable to those of natural language. This is done by performing sentiment- aware tokenization, spell correction, word normalization, segmentation (for splitting hashtags) and annotation. The implemented tokenizer with SentiWordnet corpus (Esuli and Sebastiani 2006) is able to avoid splitting expressions or words that should be kept intact (as one token), and iden- tify most emoticons, emojis, expressions such as dates, cur- rencies, acronyms, censored words (e.g. s**t), etc. In addi- tion, we perform modi\ufb01cations on the extracted tokens.",

For spelling correction, we compose a dictionary for the most commonly seen abbreviations, censored words and elon- gated words (for emphasis, e.g. \u201dreallyyy\u201d). The Viterbi al- gorithm is used for word segmentation, with word statistics (unigrams and bigrams) computed from the NLTK English Corpus to obtain the most probable segmentation posteri- ors from the unigrams and bigrams probabilities. Moreover, 4https://git.io/JvUnQ all texts are lower-cased, and URLs, emails and mentioned usernames are replaced with common designated tags so that they would not need to be annotated by the semantic parser. College Metadata The meta-statistics on the college demographics regarding enrollment, geographical location, private/public categoriza- tion and male-to-female ratio are obtained. Furthermore, we acquire the Campus Safety and Security Survey dataset from the of\ufb01cial U.S. Department of Education website and use rape-related cases statistic as an attribute to complete the data for our linear regression model.",

The number of such re- ported cases by these 200 colleges in 2015 amounts to 2,939. Methodology Regression Analysis We examine other features regarding the characteristics of the studied colleges, which might be signi\ufb01cant factors of sexual harassment. Four factual attributes pertaining to the 200 colleges are extracted from the U.S. News Statistics, which consists of Undergraduate Enrollment, Male/Female Ratio, Private/Public, and Region (Northeast, South, West, and Midwest). We also use the normalized rape-related cases count (number of cases reported per student enrolled) from the stated government resource as another attribute to ex- amine the proximity of our dataset to the of\ufb01cial one. This feature vector is then \ufb01tted in a linear regression to predict the normalized #metoo users count (number of unique users who posted #MeToo tweets per student enrolled) for each individual college.",
      "This feature vector is then \ufb01tted in a linear regression to predict the normalized #metoo users count (number of unique users who posted #MeToo tweets per student enrolled) for each individual college. Labeling Sexual Harassment Per our topic modeling results, we decide to look deeper into the narratives of #MeToo users who reveal their personal sto- ries. We examine 6,760 tweets from the most relevant topic of our LDA model, and categorize them based on the fol- lowing metrics: harassment types (verbal, physical, and vi- sual abuse) and context (peer-to-peer, school employee or work employer, and third-parties). These labels are based on de\ufb01nitions by the U.S. Dept. of Education (Cantu 2020). Topic Modeling on #MeToo Tweets In order to understand the latent topics of those #MeToo tweets for college followers, we \ufb01rst utilize Latent Dirich- let Allocation (LDA) to label universal topics demonstrated by the users. We determine the optimal topic number by se- lecting the one with the highest coherence score.",
      "We determine the optimal topic number by se- lecting the one with the highest coherence score. Since cer- tain words frequently appear in those #MeToo tweets (e.g., sexual harassment, men, women, story, etc.), we transform our corpus using TF-IDF, a term-weighting scheme that dis- counts the in\ufb02uence of common terms. Semantic Parsing with TRIPS Learning deep meaning representations, which enables the preservation of rich semantic content of entities, meaning ambiguity resolution and partial relational understanding of texts, is one of the challenges that the TRIPS parser (Allen",
      "and Teng 2018) is tasked to tackle. This kind of mean- ing is represented by TRIPS Logical Form (LF), which is a graph-based representation that serves as the interface be- tween structural analysis of text (i.e., parse) and the subse- quent use of the information to produce knowledge. The LF graphs are obtained by using the semantic types, roles and rule-based relations de\ufb01ned by the TRIPS Ontology (Allen and Teng 2018) at its core in combination with various lin- guistic techniques such as Dialogue Act Identi\ufb01cation, De- pendency Parsing, Named Entity Recognition, and Crowd- sourced Lexicon (Wordnet). Figure 1: The meaning representation of the example sen- tence \u201dHe harassed me.\u201d in TRIPS LF, the Ontology types of the words are indicated by \u201d:*\u201d and the role-argument rela- tions between them are denoted by named arcs. Figure 1 illustrates an example of the TRIPS LF graph depicting the meaning of the sentence \u201dHe harassed me,\u201d where the event described though the speech act TELL (i.e.",
      "Figure 1 illustrates an example of the TRIPS LF graph depicting the meaning of the sentence \u201dHe harassed me,\u201d where the event described though the speech act TELL (i.e. telling a story) is the verb predicate HARASS, which is caused by the agent HE and in\ufb02uences the affected (also called \u201dtheme\u201d in traditional literature) ME. As seen from the previously discussed example, the action-agent-affected relational structure is applicable to even the simplest sen- tences used for storytelling, and it is in fact very common for humans to encounter in both spoken and written languages. This makes it well suited for event extraction from short texts, useful for analyzing tweets with Twitter\u2019s 280 char- acter limit. Therefore, our implementation of TRIPS parser is particularly tailored for identifying the verb predicates in tweets and their corresponding agent-affected arguments (with 82.4% F1 score), so that we can have a solid ground for further analysis.",

Connotation Frames and Sentiment Analysis In order to develop an interpretable analysis that focuses on sentiment scores pertaining to the entities and events men- tioned in the narratives, as well as the perceptions of readers on such events, we draw from existing literature on conno- tation frames: a set of verbs annotated according to what they imply about semantically dependent entities. Connota- tion frames, \ufb01rst introduced by Rashkin, Singh, and Choi (2016), provides a framework for analyzing nuanced dimen- sions in text by combining polarity annotations with frame semantics (Fillmore 1982). More speci\ufb01cally, verbs are an- notated across various dimensions and perspectives so that a verb might elicit a positive sentiment for its subject (i.e. sympathy) but imply a negative effect for its object.",
      "More speci\ufb01cally, verbs are an- notated across various dimensions and perspectives so that a verb might elicit a positive sentiment for its subject (i.e. sympathy) but imply a negative effect for its object. We tar- get the sentiments towards the entities and verb predicates through a pre-collected set of 950 verbs that have been an- notated for these traits, which can be more clearly demon- strated through the example \u201dHe harassed me.\u201d: \u2022 Sentiment(verb)\u2212: something negative happened to the writer. \u2022 Sentiment(affected)\u2212: the writer (affected) most likely feels negative about the event. \u2022 Perspective(affected \u2192agent)\u2212: the writer most likely has negative feelings towards the agent as a result of the event. \u2022 Perspective(reader \u2192 affected)\u2212: the reader most likely view the agent as the antagonist. \u2022 Perspective(affected \u2192affected)+: the reader most likely feels sympathetic towards the writer. In addition to extracting sentiment scores from the pre- annotated corpus, we also need to predict sentiment scores of unknown verbs.",

In addition to extracting sentiment scores from the pre- annotated corpus, we also need to predict sentiment scores of unknown verbs. To achieve this task, we rely on the 200- dimensional GloVe word embeddings (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014), pretrained on their Twitter dataset, to compute the scores of the nearest neighboring synonyms contained in the annotated verb set and normalize their weighted sum to get the resulting sentiment (Equation 1). S(w) = IS(w)+(1\u2212I) 1 n X e\u2208\u03b3(w)\u2229A Pr(w \u2192e)S(e) (1) where I = 1w\u2208A is the indicator function for whether verb predicate w is in the annotation set A, \u03b3(w) is the set of near- est neighbors e\u2019s of verb w. Because our predictive model computes event-entity sentiment scores and generates verb predicate knowledge simultaneously, it is sensitive to data initialization. Therefore, we train the model iteratively on a number of random initialization to achieve the best results.",
      "Therefore, we train the model iteratively on a number of random initialization to achieve the best results. Experimental Results Topical Themes of #MeToo Tweets The results of LDA on #MeToo tweets of college users (Ta- ble 1) fall into the same pattern as the research of Mod- rek and Chakalov (2019), which suggests that a large por- tion of #MeToo tweets on Twitter focuses on sharing per- sonal traumatic stories about sexual harassment (Modrek and Chakalov 2019). In fact, in our top 5 topics, Topics 1 and 5 mainly depict gruesome stories and childhood or col- lege time experience. This \ufb01nding seems to support the va- lidity of the Twitter sample of Modrek and Chakalov (2019), where 11% discloses personal sexual harassment memo- ries and 5.8% of them was in formative years (Modrek and Chakalov 2019).

      "Observing the results of the linear regression in Table 2, we \ufb01nd the normalized governmental reported cases count and regional feature to be statistically signi\ufb01cant on the sex- ual harassment rate in the Twitter data (p \u2212value < 0.05). Speci\ufb01cally, the change in the number of reported cases con- stitutes a considerable change in the number of #MeToo users on Twitter as p-value is extremely small at 5.7e \u221213. This corresponds to the research by Napolitano (2014) re- garding the \u201dYes means yes\u201d movement in higher education institutes in recent years, as even with some limitations and inconsistency, the sexual assault reporting system is grad- ually becoming more rigorous (Napolitano 2014). Mean- while, attending colleges in the Northeast, West and South regions increases the possibility of posting about sexual ha- rassment (positive coef\ufb01cients), over the Midwest region. This \ufb01nding is interesting and warrants further scrutiny.

Event-Entity Sentiment Analysis We discover that approximately half of users who detailed their sexual harassment experiences with the #MeToo hash- tag suffered from physical aggression. Also, more than half of them claimed to encounter the perpetrators outside the college and work environment. The sentimental score for the affected entities and the verb of cases pertaining to faculty are strictly negative, suggesting that academic personnel\u2019s actions might be described as more damaging to the stu- dents\u2019 mental health. This \ufb01nding resonates a recent research by Cantapulo et al. regarding the potential hazard of sex- ual harassment conducts by university faculties using data from federal investigation and relevant social science liter- ature (Cantalupo and Kidder 2018). Furthermore, many in this group tend to mention their respective age, typically be- tween 5 and 20 (24% of the studied subset).

      "Limitations and Ethical Implications Our dataset is taken from only a sample of a speci\ufb01c set of colleges, and different samples might yield different results. Our method of identifying college students is simple, and might not re\ufb02ect the whole student population. Furthermore, the majority of posts on Twitter are short texts (under 50 words). This factor, according to previous research, might hamper the performance of the LDA results, despite the use of the TF-IDF scheme (Tang et al. 2014). Furthermore, while the main goal of this paper is to shed lights to the ongoing problems in the academia and con- tribute to the future sociological study using big data analy- sis, our dataset might be misused for detrimental purposes. Also, data regarding sexual harassment is sensitive in nature, and might have unanticipated effects on those addressed users.",
      "Conclusion In this study, we discover a novel correlation between the number of college users who participate in the #MeToo movement and the number of of\ufb01cial reported cases from the government data. This is a positive sign suggesting that the higher education system is moving into a right direc- tion to effectively utilize Title IV, a portion of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 5 which requests colleges to sub- mit their sexual misconduct reports to the of\ufb01cials and pro- tect the victims. In addition, we capture several geographic and behavioral characteristics of the #MeToo users related to sexual assault such as region, reaction and narrative con- tent following the trend, as well as sentiment and social in- teractions, some of which are supported by various literature on sexual harassment. Importantly, our semantic analysis re- veals interesting patterns of the assaulting cases. We believe our methodologies on de\ufb01ning these #MeToo users and their features will be applicable to further studies on this and other alarming social issues. Furthermore, we \ufb01nd that the social media-driven ap- proach is highly useful in facilitating crime-related sociol- ogy research on a large scale and spectrum.",
      "Furthermore, we \ufb01nd that the social media-driven ap- proach is highly useful in facilitating crime-related sociol- ogy research on a large scale and spectrum. Moreover, since social networks appeal to a broad audience, especially those outside academia, studies using these resources are highly useful for raising awareness in the community on concur- rent social problems. Last but not least, many other aspects of the text data from social media, which could provide many interesting insights on sexual harassment, remain largely untouched. In the fu- ture, we intend to explore more sophisticated language fea- tures and implement more supervised models with advanced neural network parsing and classi\ufb01cation. We believe that with our current dataset, an extension to take advantage of cutting-edge linguistic techniques will be the next step to address the previously unanswered questions and uncover deeper meanings of the tweets on sexual harassment.
