      "Unsung Challenges of Building and Deploying Language Technologies for Low Resource Language Communities Pratik Joshi1 Christain Barnes2\u2217 Sebastin Santy1 Simran Khanuja1 Sanket Shah1 Anirudh Srinivasan1 Satwik Bhattamishra1 Sunayana Sitaram1 Monojit Choudhury1 Kalika Bali1\u2020 1 Microsoft Research, Bangalore, India 2 Stanford University Abstract In this paper, we examine and analyze the challenges associated with developing and introducing language technologies to low- resource language communities. While do- ing so, we bring to light the successes and failures of past work in this area, challenges being faced in doing so, and what they have achieved. Throughout this paper, we take a problem-facing approach and describe essen- tial factors which the success of such technolo- gies hinges upon. We present the various as- pects in a manner which clarify and lay out the different tasks involved, which can aid organi- zations looking to make an impact in this area. We take the example of Gondi, an extremely- low resource Indian language, to reinforce and complement our discussion.",
      "We take the example of Gondi, an extremely- low resource Indian language, to reinforce and complement our discussion. 1 Introduction Technology pervades all aspects of society and continues to change the way people access and share information, learn and educate, as well as provide and access services. Language is the main medium through which such transforma- tional technology can be integrated into the so- cioeconomic processes of a community. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech systems, therefore, break down barriers and enable users and whole communities with easy access to infor- mation and services. However, the current trend in building language technology is designed to work on languages with very high resources in terms of data and infrastructure. Also, as Machine Learning (ML) and NLP prac- titioners, we get caught up in an information- theoretic view of the problem, e.g., focusing on incremental improvements of performance on benchmarks or capturing accurate distributions \u2217Work done during internship at Microsoft Research \u2020Email: kalikab@microsoft.com Figure 1: The points represent the disparity between number of wikipedia articles in comparison with the number of native speakers for a particular language.",
      "over data, and tend to forget that the raison d\u2019\u0142tre of NLP is to build systems that add value to its users (Ruder, 2019). We want to build models that enable people to read the news that was not written in their language, ask questions about their health when they do not have access to a doctor, etc. And while these technology applications are more and more ubiquitous for languages with a lot of data, a larger majority of languages remain resource-poor and bereft of such systems. As dis- cussed in the United Nations e-government survey (Nations, 2014), one of the most important obsta- cles to e-inclusion, particularly among vulnerable groups with little education, is language. Thus, by excluding these languages from reaping the ben- e\ufb01ts of the advancements in language technology, we marginalize the already vulnerable groups even further. India is a highly multilingual society and home to some of the largest language communities in the world. 6 out of 20 most-spoken (native) languages in the world are Indic.",
      "India is a highly multilingual society and home to some of the largest language communities in the world. 6 out of 20 most-spoken (native) languages in the world are Indic. Ethnologue (Simons and Fennig, 2017) records 461 tongues in India out of 6912 worldwide (6%), the 4th largest belonging to any single country in the world. 122 of these arXiv:1912.03457v1  [cs.CL]  7 Dec 2019",
      "languages are spoken by more than 10,000 peo- ple. 29 languages have more than 1 million speak- ers, which include indigenous tribal languages like Gondi and Mundari, some without a supported writing system or script. Despite the large num- bers of users, most of these languages have very little data available. Figure 1 shows that as com- pared to some of the much lesser spoken languages like German, Indic languages are severely low re- sourced. In a vast country like India, access to information thus becomes a huge concern. This lack of information means that not only do these communities not have information in domains like agriculture, health, weather etc., which could im- prove their quality of lives, but they may also not be aware of their basic rights as citizens of the country. In this paper, we take the position that the cur- rent direction of advanced language technology to- wards extremely high data requirements can have severe socio-economic implications for a majority of language communities in the world. We focus on speci\ufb01c aspects of designing and building sys- tems and applications for low resource languages and their speech communities to exemplify viable social impact through language technology.",
      "We focus on speci\ufb01c aspects of designing and building sys- tems and applications for low resource languages and their speech communities to exemplify viable social impact through language technology. We begin by discussing the aspect of information ex- change, which is the core motivation behind en- abling low-resource language communities. We then steer our analysis towards the design and cre- ation of an interface for people in these communi- ties to simplify and enrich the process of informa- tion exchange. Finally, we gather insights about how to deploy these technologies to ensure ex- tensive impact by studying and taking inspiration from existing technological deployments. We use Gondi, a South-Central Dravidian lan- guage in the vulnerable category on UNESCO\u2019s Atlas of the Worlds Languages in Danger (Mose- ley, 2010), as an example wherever possible. Spo- ken by nearly 3 million people (India, 2011) in the Indian states of Chhattisgarh, Andhra, Odisha, Maharashtra and Karnataka, it is heavily in\ufb02u- enced by the dominant state language.",
      "Spo- ken by nearly 3 million people (India, 2011) in the Indian states of Chhattisgarh, Andhra, Odisha, Maharashtra and Karnataka, it is heavily in\ufb02u- enced by the dominant state language. However, it is also one of the least resourced languages in India, with very little available data and technol- ogy. We believe that the components discussed in the sections below encapsulate the spectrum of issues surrounding this \ufb01eld and that all future discus- sions in this area will also fall under the umbrella of these categories. We believe that by focusing on Gondi, we will not only empower the Gondi community but more importantly, understand and create a pipeline or framework which can serve as a clear guide for potential ventures which plan on introducing disruptive language technologies in under-served communities. 2 Information Exchange The primary element in communication is infor- mation exchange. People living in less connected areas are often unable to get the kind of informa- tion they need, due to various socio-economical and technological barriers. As a result, they miss out on crucial knowledge required to improve their well-being.",
      "People living in less connected areas are often unable to get the kind of informa- tion they need, due to various socio-economical and technological barriers. As a result, they miss out on crucial knowledge required to improve their well-being. There are three co-dependent aspects woven into the fabric of information exchange - access of information, quality and coverage of the information and methods to create and digitize available knowledge (generation). 2.1 Access This section refers to past work and current ven- tures of making digital resources adequately avail- able and accessible to people. 2.1.1 Making information accessible to people Less-connected and technologically underdevel- oped areas often suffer from the limited accessi- bility of up-to-date information. Providing more individuals access to the online repositories of in- formation can often help them improve their well- being. There are some situations particularly during natural calamities where the absence of noti\ufb01ca- tions about potentially disaster-prone areas can re- sult in life and death situations of individuals. Peo- ple in regions with sparse connectivity often fall victim to these incidents due to lack of timely up- dates.",
      "Peo- ple in regions with sparse connectivity often fall victim to these incidents due to lack of timely up- dates. Using technical platforms to support the spread of information to these regions is an impor- tant goal to keep in mind. LORELEI (Strassel and Tracey, 2016) is a DARPA funded initiative with the goal of the building of technologies for deal- ing and responding to disasters in low resource language communities. Similar initiatives in India would be capable of saving lives. The daily function and health of individuals in a community can be in\ufb02uenced positively by the dissemination of relevant information. For example, healthcare and agricultural knowledge",
      "can affect the prosperity of a rural household, making them aware of potential solutions and remedies which can be acquired. There has been a considerable body of work focused on technology for healthcare access, which includes telemedicine (Brauchli et al., 2005) and remote di- agnosis (Surana et al., 2008). While the use of telecenters to spread information on agricultural practises has been employed, persuading users to regularly use the telecenters (Ramamritham et al., 2006) is a challenge, which could be addressed by the use of language technologies to simplify access. VideoKheti (Cuendet et al., 2013) is an example of a voice-based application which pro- vides educational videos to farmers about effective agricultural practices. Similar studies have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of voice- activated applications for farming (Patel et al., 2010). There are considerable challenges, how- ever, to ensure that these solutions are inclusive and accessible to low-literate and less-connected users. Similarly, there are situations where there are certain rights and duties which an individual as a citizen of India is entitled to.",
      "There are considerable challenges, how- ever, to ensure that these solutions are inclusive and accessible to low-literate and less-connected users. Similarly, there are situations where there are certain rights and duties which an individual as a citizen of India is entitled to. Some communi- ties have long been exploited and ill-treated (Gan- guly and Chaudhary, 2003), and providing them information regarding their rights as well as accu- rate news could foster a sense of solidarity within the community and encourage them to make their voice heard. An extensive study on the impact of CGNet Swara (Marathe et al., 2015) showed that this citizen journalism platform inspired peo- ple in rural communities, gave them a feeling of being heard, and provided a venue to voice their grievances. There are also other promising ven- tures such as Awaaz De (Patel et al., 2010) and Gram Vaani (Moitra et al., 2016) which aim to boost social activism in a similar manner.",
      "There are also other promising ven- tures such as Awaaz De (Patel et al., 2010) and Gram Vaani (Moitra et al., 2016) which aim to boost social activism in a similar manner. 2.1.2 Making more digital content available The process of enabling more low-resource lan- guage communities with tools to access online information alone is not suf\ufb01cient. There need to be steps taken to make more of the content which exists online interpretable to people in these communities. For example, The Indian Consti- tution and other similar of\ufb01cial communications from the government are written in 22 scheduled languages of India. Lack of access to other re- lated documents deprives them of basic informa- tion. This is where building robust machine trans- lation tools for low resource languages can help. Cross-language information retrieval makes ex- tensive use of these translation mechanisms (Zhou et al., 2012) where information is retrieved in a language different from the language of the user\u2019s query. McNamee and May\ufb01eld (2002) describes a system making use of minimal resources to per- form the same.",
      "McNamee and May\ufb01eld (2002) describes a system making use of minimal resources to per- form the same. There is huge potential for language technolo- gies to be involved in content creation and infor- mation access. Further, more accurate retrieval methods can help the user get relevant information speci\ufb01c to their needs and context in their own lan- guage. 2.1.3 Making NLP models more accessible to low resource languages Often, many state-of-the-art tools cannot be ap- plied to low-resource languages due to the lack of data. Table 1 describes the various technologies and their presence concerning languages with dif- ferent levels of resource availability and the ease of data collection. We can observe that for low re- source languages, there is considerable dif\ufb01culty in adopting these tools. Machine Translation can potentially be used as a \ufb01x to bridge the gap. Translation engines can help in translating docu- ments from minority languages to majority lan- guages. This allows the pool of data to be used in a number of NLP tasks like sentiment anal- ysis and summarization.",
      "Translation engines can help in translating docu- ments from minority languages to majority lan- guages. This allows the pool of data to be used in a number of NLP tasks like sentiment anal- ysis and summarization. Doing so allows us to leverage the existing body of work in NLP done on resource-rich languages and subsequently ap- ply it to the resource-poor languages, thereby fore- going any attempt to reinvent the wheel for these languages. This ensures a quicker and wider im- pact.Wan (2008) performs sentiment analysis on Chinese customer reviews by translating them to English. They observe that the quality of ma- chine translation systems are suf\ufb01cient for senti- ment analysis to be performed on the automati- cally translated texts without a substantial trade- off in accuracy. 2.2 Generation This section refers to the generation of digital con- tent which enriches online repositories with more diverse sets of information. 2.2.1 Digitization of Documents There is a need to generate digital information and content for low-resource languages.

Efforts to dig- itize content in India have been conducted in the past few years. The Government of India launched the Digital India initiative 1 in 2015, which aims to digitize government documents in one of In- dia\u2019s 120+ local languages. Such initiatives have evidently been useful before. For instance, the IMPACT project 2 by the European Union was a large scale digitization project which helped push a lot of innovative work towards OCR and lan- guage technology for historical text retrieval and processing.",

IMPRINT is a similar initiative cre- ated by the Ministry of Human Resource Devel- opment (MHRD) to drive further research towards addressing such challenges. The recent advancements in OCR technologies can propel efforts to digitize more handwritten documents. Such initiatives are already being un- dertaken to digitize and revive historical languages 1http://www.digitalindia.gov.in/ 2http://www.impact-project.eu/ in Japan (Clanuwat et al., 2018). Digital India library is a project that aims towards digitizing books and making them available online. Apart from printed books, a lot of ancient literature is written on palm leaves. The Regional Mega Scan Centre (RMSC) at IIIT Hyderabad has digitized over 100,000 books, one-third of which are in In- dian Languages and additionally, they have also digitized text from scans of palm leaves.",
      "The Regional Mega Scan Centre (RMSC) at IIIT Hyderabad has digitized over 100,000 books, one-third of which are in In- dian Languages and additionally, they have also digitized text from scans of palm leaves. More ini- tiatives such as these will help preserve and revive a number of languages that are part of the Indian heritage. 2.2.2 Crowdsourcing Data collection via crowdsourcing can be a chal- lenge for low resource languages, primarily due to the expensive nature of the task coupled with the lack of commercial demand for such data. Thus, collecting this data at low cost becomes an important priority. Project Karya is a crowd- sourcing platform which provides digital work to low-income workers. Although the data quality can be a concern, promising results have shown otherwise. Chopra et al. (2019) tested the qual- ity of crowdsourced data in rural regions of In-",
      "dia, tasking individuals with the digitization of Hindi/Marathi handwritten documents. A 96.7% accuracy of annotation was yielded, proving that there is potential in this area. Recently, collec- tion of Marathi speech data is also being con- ducted. In a similar fashion, Navana Tech3, a startup, has been collecting data in mid and low- resource languages of verbal banking queries so that they can be integrated into various banking application platforms for \ufb01nancial inclusion. Such crowdsourcing platforms not only act as a poten- tial data for low-resource communities, they also bene\ufb01t low-income workers by increasing their current daily wage. Such ventures would enhance the inclusion of such workers in the digitization process, something which aligns with the aims of the Digital India mission. The collection of data in an extremely low- resource language like Gondi can be particularly tricky, additionally considering the fact that Gondi does not have an of\ufb01cial script. Pratham Books 4 is a non-pro\ufb01t organization which aims to democ- ratize access to books for children.",
      "Pratham Books 4 is a non-pro\ufb01t organization which aims to democ- ratize access to books for children. They recently hosted a workshop where they trained members of the local community to translate books on Story- Weaver5, their open-source publication platform. At the end of this workshop, approximately 200 books were translated from Hindi to Gondi (De- vanagiri script). This was the \ufb01rst time children\u2019s books were made available in Gondi, and it also sparked the creation of parallel data for Hindi- Gondi translation systems. 3 Interface The design of a user-friendly interface plays a very crucial role in ensuring that the deployed technol- ogy encompasses all strata of society. It is often seen that a majority of target users have not had the privilege of education, and show varying lev- els of literacy, both foundational and digital. In such scenarios, text-based modalities pose several limitations from both the user and designer per- spectives, and graphical user interfaces have been the preferred choice in these applications. Thies et al.",
      "In such scenarios, text-based modalities pose several limitations from both the user and designer per- spectives, and graphical user interfaces have been the preferred choice in these applications. Thies et al. (2015) reports that text-based interfaces were completely redundant for illiterate users and severely error-prone for literate but novice users. Further, several languages do not have unique key- 3https://navanatech.in/ 4https://prathambooks.org/ 5https://storyweaver.org.in/ board standards or fonts, and some do not have a script at all (Boyera, 2007). To overcome these issues with text, speech as a modality has also been deployed with varying success. \u2018CGNet Swara\u2019, a citizen-run journal- ism portal, uses a phone-based IVR system to ed- ucate illiterate users (Mudliar et al., 2013). Avaaj Utalo allows users to make simple phone calls to ask questions or browse questions and answers asked on agricultural topics (Patel et al., 2010).",
      "Avaaj Utalo allows users to make simple phone calls to ask questions or browse questions and answers asked on agricultural topics (Patel et al., 2010). Spoken Web is another application wherein users can create voice sites analogous to websites which can then be easily accessed through voice inter- action on mobile phones (Kumar et al., 2010). These serve to provide farmers with relevant crop and market information. An attempt to leverage the complementarity of voice and graphic-based inputs was made by VideoKheti, a mobile sys- tem with a multi-modal interface for low-literate farmers providing agricultural extension videos on command in their own language or dialect (Cuen- det et al., 2013). They report that people in these communities \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to use softkey type keyboards that are extremely common on mod- ern smartphones. Instead, they proposed a system comprising of large buttons, graphics and some voice input. Such a system for delivering infor- mation to farmers was made and they showed that the farmers were very comfortable using it.",
      "Instead, they proposed a system comprising of large buttons, graphics and some voice input. Such a system for delivering infor- mation to farmers was made and they showed that the farmers were very comfortable using it. Their results also show that a speech interface alone was not enough for that scenario, except in cases where the search list was long and the results were de- pendent on keywords or short phrases. Similarly, the Adivasi Radio App 6, based on text-to-speech (TTS) technology, is developed to read out writ- ten reports in Gondi, one of the main tribal lan- guages in Chhattisgarh. Bolo is another mobile application which uses a very simple interface to improve children\u2019s literacy in India. Project Karya also proposes to divide massive digital tasks into microwork and crowdsource this work to millions of people in rural India via phones 7. While voice might solve the foundational liter- acy problems, the lack of digital literacy is often more challenging to overcome. (Mondal, 2019) demonstrate the use of an app to teach the Mundari language to children.",

Relying on voice-based systems also poses a few challenges. It is not easy to build robust ASR systems for these languages due to severe lack of data, dialect variations and several such constraints. An attempt to resolve this was made with the development of the SALAAM ASR (Qiao et al., 2010) which uses the acoustic model of an existing ASR and performs a cross-lingual phoneme mapping between the source and target language. This, however, is limited to recognition of a very small set of vocabulary, but \ufb01nds use due to its\u2019 cost-effective and low resource setting. 4 Deployment and Impact After developing technologies to provide informa- tion, and ensuring that the applications are de- signed in such a way that they are accessible to the population, the technology must be effec- tively deployed. Specialized applications are use- less if they are not deployed properly in a way that accesses their end-users.",
      "Specialized applications are use- less if they are not deployed properly in a way that accesses their end-users. When deploying a specially developed technology, the application must be deployed with consideration of the exist- ing community dynamics. For any deployment to be successful, it usually must be able to be pur- posefully integrated into the lifestyle of commu- nity members - or have strong utilization incen- tives if it is a transformative technology. In this section, we will review examples of technology dissemination to low-resource/rural communities, and the impacts of effective deployment. While some technologies that we examine are not de- ployed utilizing low-resource languages speci\ufb01- cally, the types of rural communities and villages in which they are deployed are analogous to the contexts in which low-resource languages exist, and clear parallels can be drawn. Integrating the usage of a language technology intervention into a community in a low-resource context requires much more simply introducing the technology. Unlike hardware interventions and innovations like solar panels or new agricultural tools, language technologies often rely on the de- livery, exchange, and utilization of information, which is much less tangible than physical solu- tions.",
      "Unlike hardware interventions and innovations like solar panels or new agricultural tools, language technologies often rely on the de- livery, exchange, and utilization of information, which is much less tangible than physical solu- tions. This is especially for people with limited previous exposure to digital technology. Upon observing a selection of language-based interven- tions that were deployed in low-resource contexts, we observed that the most successful deployments of technologies tended to have three components of success. They: 1) Initially launched by seed- ing with target communities, 2) Worked closely to engage the community itself with the technology and information, and 3) Provided a strong incen- tive structure to adapt the technology - this incen- tive could be as simple as payments or as complex as communicated bene\ufb01ts from the technology. 4.1 Case Studies In this section, we will be reviewing and comparing three separate technological systems, Learn2Earn (Swaminathan et al.), Mobile Vaani (Moitra et al., 2016), and the Climate and Agri- culture Information Service (CAIS)(Christensen et al., 2019), and see how they utilized the rules of successful deployment outlined above.",
      "), Mobile Vaani (Moitra et al., 2016), and the Climate and Agri- culture Information Service (CAIS)(Christensen et al., 2019), and see how they utilized the rules of successful deployment outlined above. Learn2Earn, developed by Microsoft Research, is a simple IVR based mobile language technology app which uses quizzes to educate people and spread public awareness campaigns, launched ini- tially in rural central India. Mobile Vaani is a large-scale and broad community-based IVR me- dia exchange platform, developed by the NGO Gram Vaani. It currently has over 100,000 unique monthly active users, and processes 10,000 calls per day across the three Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Madhya Pradesh. Finally, the CAIS system is an SMS-based information deliv- ery system designed for farmers who live in a ru- ral, low-resource and no connectivity agricultural village on the Char Islands in the Bangladeshi Chalan Beel Wetland. This application provides weather data and agricultural advice to farmers on a periodic basis and was developed by a col- laboration between mPower and two local NGOs.",
      "This application provides weather data and agricultural advice to farmers on a periodic basis and was developed by a col- laboration between mPower and two local NGOs. After designing the platform in accessible ways, each deployment process began with the seeding within a target community within itself. All ex- amples that we studied became successful only af- ter a small scale launch of their product. These launches occurred in different ways but were all based on targeting a starting group of users and in- centivizing them to utilize and share the product. The initial users were people who were somewhat \ufb02uent in the technology (either through training or existing knowledge), and who knew of or had spe- cialized needs that the technology could address.",
      "4.1.1 Learn2Earn Learn2Earn was built as a tech-enabled informa- tion dissemination system; its original information awareness campaign centred on informing farmers about their rights as guaranteed in Indias Forest Rights act. Because of the nature of their mes- sage content and delivery, the researchers decided to seed the platform with a single advertisement on an existing IVR channel already utilized by farm- ers. This advertisement reached 150 people, and provided them with distinct \ufb01nancial incentives to both call the platform, and invite friends to the platform. While only 17 of the original listeners of the advertisement went on to call the number, those respondents were members of the relevant community (farmers who were familiar with IVR technology) and were networked through family and friendships to additional ideal users of the platform. Within 7 weeks, the incentive structure allowed the platform to spread from the original 17 users to over 17,000, with little in\ufb02uence from the platform respondents. (Swaminathan et al.) 4.1.2 Mobile Vaani Mobile Vaani initially tried to launch in 2011 by encouraging employees from their partner NGOs to distribute their platform.",
      "(Swaminathan et al.) 4.1.2 Mobile Vaani Mobile Vaani initially tried to launch in 2011 by encouraging employees from their partner NGOs to distribute their platform. The platform was initially imagined as a voice-based, inclu- sive medium for communities to express their grievances and communicate with each other dig- itally. The initial employees who recruited for the platform were not from the community but did work closely with them regularly. While there was some initial success in the launch, the mobile Vaani Team were unable to grow at a signi\ufb01cant pace because they informed the end-users about their intended design and usage of the technology, which set unrealistic expectations of the platform in the minds of the participating users after the technology could not be used in the exact way that it was encouraged. A few months later, the plat- form decided to re-launch and expand by recruit- ing a series of trained and compensated volunteers from a variety of communities that they hoped to engage. During the second launch, the commu- nity members were able to learn about the plat- form, and adapt it to their speci\ufb01c use cases.",
      "During the second launch, the commu- nity members were able to learn about the plat- form, and adapt it to their speci\ufb01c use cases. The platform began to gain popularity during a teach- ers strike in the state of Jharkhand where a speci\ufb01c use case for expressing grievances powered by the community arose. 4.1.3 CAIS The CAIS platform launched in direct collabora- tion with the NGO partner for the village ev- ery available farmer registered their name, num- ber, and crop type with the NGO partner and consequently the target population was integrated from the start. As the programs grew, each en- gaged with the community on a high level. In the case of all three platforms, a speci\ufb01c population, and a very speci\ufb01c understanding of that popula- tions needs had to be identi\ufb01ed before the plat- form could be relatively effective. Even after the deployment of the platform, care and close inte- gration with community systems had to be done.",
      "Even after the deployment of the platform, care and close inte- gration with community systems had to be done. The village in which CAIS worked had a system of self-empowerment groups, that had been orga- nized by the NGO. Each group had a leader; and while not every villager in each group had a ba- sic phone, every group leader did. Consequently, the researchers behind CAIS worked to ensure that every group leader was engaged in with CAIS and that they would relay their CAIS informational up- dates to the villagers that they lead. Similarly, the CAIS researchers worked closely with village leaders to determine who was able to access the information in SMS form and deployed informa- tional physical posters as a substitute to those por- tions of the village population who could not. This intensive work led to the successful adaptation of technology to the bene\ufb01t of the farmers yields. The researchers behind the Vaani system also con- tinued to expand the system through a local net- work of volunteers.",
      "This intensive work led to the successful adaptation of technology to the bene\ufb01t of the farmers yields. The researchers behind the Vaani system also con- tinued to expand the system through a local net- work of volunteers. (Moitra et al., 2016) 4.1.4 CGNET Swara CGNet Swara, which we introduced earlier in this paper, also increased their initial participation by engaging with the wider community by holding in- person training and awareness sessions. They have conducted over 50 workshops, and have trained more than 2,000 members of various communities (Marathe et al., 2015). Outreach activities such as these also allowed an increased spread of aware- ness via word-of-mouth. From these examples, it is clear to see that community engagement is the absolute key to spreading technology. Incentives both monetary and situational are a huge way that these platforms were able to engage their initial users. Incentives served to empower individuals to become champions of the platform and increased the enabled them to use their knowledge of the community and existing peer networks to deliver",
      "the technology where it was needed. All plat- forms used incentives of some sort; Learn2Earn used a direct payment for recruitment + participa- tion, and also delivered relevant topics to the users. Mobile Vaani provided \ufb01nancial incentives to the volunteers who mobilized to evangelize the prod- uct. CAIS did not provide monetary incentives but instead brought technology that had an actionable and tangential impact on the daily lives of farmers. With the deployment of these technologies, direct needs of the population were solved. 5 Conclusion The boost in recent advancements in NLP research has started breaking down communication and in- formation barriers. This, coupled with in-depth studies on the socio-economic bene\ufb01ts of enabling less-connected communities with technology, pro- vides a strong argument for increasing investment in this area. It is promising to observe increased innovation and steady progress in the empower- ment of rural communities using language tools. Increased exposure to the challenges and works in this area can catalyse developments in improv- ing inclusion and information dissemination. We hope that this paper will provide pointers in the right direction for potential ventures that plan on introducing disruptive language technologies to marginalized communities.
