Current neural machine translation (NMT) systems translate a text in a conventional sentence-by-sentence fashion, ignoring such cross-sentence links and dependen- cies. This may lead to generate an incoherent target text for a coherent source text. In order to handle this issue, we propose a cache-based approach to modeling coherence for neural machine translation by capturing contextual information either from recently translated sentences or the entire document.",
      "This may lead to generate an incoherent target text for a coherent source text. In order to handle this issue, we propose a cache-based approach to modeling coherence for neural machine translation by capturing contextual information either from recently translated sentences or the entire document. Particularly, we explore two types of caches: a dynamic cache, which stores words from the best translation hypotheses of preceding sentences, and a topic cache, which maintains a set of target-side topical words that are semantically related to the document to be translated. On this basis, we build a new layer to score target words in these two caches with a cache-based neural model. Here the estimated probabilities from the cache-based neural model are combined with NMT probabilities into the \ufb01nal word prediction probabilities via a gating mechanism. Finally, the proposed cache-based neural model is trained jointly with NMT sys- tem in an end-to-end manner. Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed cache-based model achieves substantial improvements over several state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines.",
      "Finally, the proposed cache-based neural model is trained jointly with NMT sys- tem in an end-to-end manner. Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed cache-based model achieves substantial improvements over several state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines. Neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) as an emerging machine translation approach, quickly achieves the state-of-the-art translation performance on many language pairs, e.g., English-French (Jean et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015b), English-German (Shen et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a) and so on. In principle, NMT is established on an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder reads a source sentence and encodes it into a \ufb01xed-length semantic vector, and the decoder generates a translation according to this vector. In spite of its current success, NMT translates sentences of a text independently, ignoring document- level information during translation. This largely limits its success since document-level information imposes constraints on the translations of individual sentences of a text.",
      "In spite of its current success, NMT translates sentences of a text independently, ignoring document- level information during translation. This largely limits its success since document-level information imposes constraints on the translations of individual sentences of a text. And such document-level con- straints, at least, can be categorized into three aspects: consistency, disambiguation and coherence. First, the same phrases or terms should be translated consistently across the entire text as much as possible, no matter in which sentence they occur. If sentences of a text are translated independent of each other, it will be dif\ufb01cult to maintain the translation consistency across different sentences. Second, document-level information provides a global context that can help disambiguate words with multiple senses if sentence- level local context is not suf\ufb01cient for disambiguation. Third, the topic of a document is able to keep individual sentences translated in a coherent way.",

Third, the topic of a document is able to keep individual sentences translated in a coherent way. In the literature, such informative constraints have been occasionally investigated in statistical machine translation and achieved certain success via a variety of document-level models, such as cache-based language and translation models (Tiedemann, 2010; Gong et al., 2011; Nepveu et al., 2004) for the consistency constraint, topic-based coherence model (Xiong and Zhang, 2013; Tam et al., 2007) for the coherence constraint. By contrast, in neural machine translation, to the best of our knowledge, such constraints have not been explored so far. \u2217Corresponding author arXiv:1711.11221v3  [cs.CL]  14 Jun 2018",
      "Partially inspired by the success of cache models in SMT, we propose a cache-based approach to capturing coherence for neural machine translation. Particularly, we incorporate two types of caches into NMT: a static topic cache and a dynamic cache being updated on the \ufb02y. For the topic cache, we \ufb01rst use a projection-based bilingual topic learning approach to infer the topic distribution for each document to be translated and obtain the corresponding topical words on the target side. These topical words are then integrated into the topic cache. For the dynamic cache, words are retrieved from the best translation hypotheses of recently translated sentences. While the topic cache builds a global pro\ufb01le for a document, which helps impose the coherence constraint on document translation, the dynamic cache follows an intuition that words occurred previously should have higher probabilities of recurrence even if they are rare words in the training data. In order to integrate these two caches into neural machine translation, we further propose a cache- based neural model, which adds a new neural network layer on the cache component to score each word in the cache.",
      "In order to integrate these two caches into neural machine translation, we further propose a cache- based neural model, which adds a new neural network layer on the cache component to score each word in the cache. During decoding, we estimate the probability of a word from the cache according to its score and combine this cache probability with the original probability computed by the decoder via a gating mechanism to obtain the \ufb01nal word prediction probability. On the NIST Chinese-English translation tasks, our experiment results show that the proposed cache- based neural approach can achieve signi\ufb01cant improvements of up to 1.60 BLEU points on average (up to 2.53 BLEU points on NIST04) over the state-of-the-art attention-based NMT baseline. 1 Related Work In the literature, several cache-based translation models have been proposed for conventional statistical machine translation, besides traditional n-gram language models and neural language models.

In this section, we will \ufb01rst introduce related work in cache-based language models and then in translation models. For traditional n-gram language models, Kuhn and De Mori (1990) propose a cache-based language model, which mixes a large global language model with a small local model estimated from recent items in the history of the input stream for speech recongnition. Della Pietra et al. (1992) introduce a MaxEnt- based cache model by integrating a cache into a smoothed trigram language model, reporting reduction in both perplexity and word error rates. Chueh and Chien (2010) present a new topic cache model for speech recongnition based on latent Dirichlet language model by incorporating a large-span topic cache into the generation of topic mixtures. For neural language models, Huang et al.

      "Our caches are similar to those used by Gong et al. (2011) who incorporate these caches into statistical machine translation. We adapt them to neural machine translation with a neural cache model. It is worthwhile to emphasize that such adaptation is nontrivial as shown below because the two translation philosophies and frameworks are signi\ufb01cantly different. 2 Attention-based NMT In this section, we brie\ufb02y describe the NMT model taken as a baseline. Without loss of generality, we adopt the NMT architecture proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015), with an encoder-decoder neural network. 2.1 Encoder The encoder uses bidirectional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNN) to encode a source sentence with a forward and a backward RNN. The forward RNN takes as input a source sentence x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ) from left to right and outputs a hidden state sequence (\u2212\u2192 h1, \u2212\u2192 h2, ..., \u2212\u2192 hT ) while the backward RNN reads the sentence in an inverse direction and outputs a backward hidden state sequence (\u2190\u2212 h1, \u2190\u2212 h2, ..., \u2190\u2212 hT ).",
      "The context-dependent word representations of the source sentence hj (also known as word annotation vec- tors) are the concatenation of hidden states \u2212\u2192 hj and \u2190\u2212 hj in the two directions. 2.2 Decoder The decoder is an RNN that predicts target words yt via a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network.

The prediction is based on the decoder RNN hidden state st, the previous predicted word yt\u22121 and a source-side context vector ct. The hidden state st of the decoder at time t and the conditional probability of the next word yt are computed as follows: st = f(st\u22121, yt\u22121, ct) (1) p(yt|y<t; x) = g(yt\u22121, st, ct) (2) 2.3 Attention Model In the attention model, the context vector ct is calculated as a weighted sum over source annotation vectors (h1, h2, ..., hT ): ct = Tx X j=1 \u03b1tjhj (3) \u03b1tj = exp(etj) PT k=1 exp(etk) (4) etj = a(st\u22121, hj) (5) where \u03b1tj is the attention weight of each hidden state hj computed by the attention model, and a is a feed forward neural network with a single hidden layer.",
      "The dl4mt tutorial1 presents an improved implementation of the attention-based NMT system, which feeds the previous word yt\u22121 to the attention model. We use the dl4mt tutorial implementation as our baseline, which we will refer to as RNNSearch*.

In this section, we introduce our proposed dynamic cache and topic cache in detail. 3.1.1 Dynamic Cache In order to build the dynamic cache, we dynamically extract words from recently translated sentences and the partial translation of current sentence being translated as words of dynamic cache.

      "3.1.1 Dynamic Cache In order to build the dynamic cache, we dynamically extract words from recently translated sentences and the partial translation of current sentence being translated as words of dynamic cache. We apply the following rules to build the dynamic cache. a) The max size of the dynamic cache is set to |cd|. b) According to the \ufb01rst-in-\ufb01rst-out rule, when the dynamic cache is full and a new word is inserted into the cache, the oldest word in the cache will be removed. c) Duplicate entries into the dynamic cache are not allowed when a word has been already in the cache. It is worth noting that we also maintain a stop word list, and we added English punctuations and \u201cUNK\u201d into our stop word list. Words in the stop word list would not be inserted into the dynamic cache. So the common words like \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d cannot appear in the cache. All words in the dynamic cache can be found in the target-side vocabulary of RNNSearch*.",

All words in the dynamic cache can be found in the target-side vocabulary of RNNSearch*. 3.1.2 Topic Cache In order to build the topic cache, we \ufb01rst use an off-the-shelf LDA topic tool2 to learn topic distributions of source- and target-side documents separately. Then we estimate a topic projection distribution over all target-side topics p(zt|zs) for each source topic zs by collecting events and accumulating counts of (zs, zt) from aligned document pairs. Notice that zs/zt is the topic with the highest topic probability p(z.|d) on the source/target side. Then we can use the topic cache as follows: 1) During the training process of NMT, the learned target-side topic model is used to infer the topic distribution for each target document. For a target document d in the training data, we select the topic z with the highest probability p(z|d) as the topic for the document.",
      "For a target document d in the training data, we select the topic z with the highest probability p(z|d) as the topic for the document. The |ct| most probable topical words in topic z are extracted to \ufb01ll the topic cache for the document d. 2) In the NMT testing process, we \ufb01rst infer the topic distribution for a source document in question with the learned source-side topic model. From the topic distribution, we choose the topic with the highest probability as the topic for the source document. Then we use the learned topic projection function to 2http://www.arbylon.net/projects/",

After that, we use the |ct| most probable topical words in the projected target topic to \ufb01ll the topic cache. The words of topic cache and dynamic cache together form the \ufb01nal cache model. In practice, the cache stores word embeddings, as shown in Figure 3. As we do not want to introduce extra embedding parameters, we let the cache share the same target word embedding matrix with the NMT model. In this case, if a word is not in the target-side vocabulary of NMT, we discard the word from the cache. 3.2 The Model The cache-based neural model is to evaluate the probabilities of words occurring in the cache and to provide the evaluation results for the decoder via a gating mechanism.",

In this paper, we build a new neural network layer as the scorer for the cache. At each decoding step t, we use the scorer to score yt if yt is in the cache. The inputs to the scorer are the current hidden state st of the decoder, previous word yt\u22121, context vector ct, and the word yt from the cache. The score of yt is calculated as follows: score(yt|y<t, x) = gcache(st, ct, yt\u22121, yt) (6) where gcache is a non-linear function.",
      "The score of yt is calculated as follows: score(yt|y<t, x) = gcache(st, ct, yt\u22121, yt) (6) where gcache is a non-linear function. This score is further used to estimate the cache probability of yt as follows: pcache(yt|y<t, x) = softmax(score(yt|y<t, x)) (7) 3.2.2 Integrating the Cache-based Neural Model into NMT Since we have two prediction probabilities for the next target word yt, one from the cache-based neural model pcache, the other originally estimated by the NMT decoder pnmt, how do we integrate these two probabilities? Here, we introduce a gating mechanism to combine them, and word prediction probabili- ties on the vocabulary of NMT are updated by combining the two probabilities through linear interpola- tion between the NMT probability and cache-based neural model probability.",
      "Here, we introduce a gating mechanism to combine them, and word prediction probabili- ties on the vocabulary of NMT are updated by combining the two probabilities through linear interpola- tion between the NMT probability and cache-based neural model probability. The \ufb01nal word prediction probability for yt is calculated as follows: p(yt|y<t, x) = (1 \u2212\u03b1t)pcache(yt|y<t, x) + \u03b1tpnmt(yt|y<t, x) (8) Notice that if yt is not in the cache, we set pcache(yt|y<t, x) = 0, where \u03b1t is the gate and computed as follows: \u03b1t = ggate(fgate(st, ct, yt\u22121)) (9) where fgate is a non-linear function and ggate is sigmoid function.",
      "We use the contextual elements of st, ct, yt\u22121 to score the current target word occurring in the cache (Eq. (6)) and to estimate the gate (Eq. (9)). If the target word is consistent with the context and in the cache at the same time, the probability of the target word will be high. Finally, we train the proposed cache model jointly with the NMT model towards minimizing the negative log-likelihood on the training corpus. The cost function is computed as follows: L(\u03b8) = \u2212 N X i=1 T X t=1 logp(yt|y<t, x) (10) where \u03b8 are all parameters in the cache-based NMT model. 3.3 Decoding Process Our cache-based NMT system works as follows: (1) When the decoder shifts to a new test document, clear the topic and dynamic cache. (2) Obtain target topical words for the new test document as described in Section 4.1 and \ufb01ll them in the topic cache. (3) Clear the dynamic cache when translating the \ufb01rst sentence of the test document.",
      "(2) Obtain target topical words for the new test document as described in Section 4.1 and \ufb01ll them in the topic cache. (3) Clear the dynamic cache when translating the \ufb01rst sentence of the test document. (4) For each sentence in the new test document, translate it with the proposed cache-based NMT and continuously expands the dynamic cache with newly generated target words and target words ob- tained from the best translation hypothesis of previous sentences. In this way, the topic cache can provide useful global information at the beginning of the translation process while the dynamic cache is growing with the progress of translation. 4 Experimentation We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed cache-based neural model for neural machine translation on NIST Chinese-English translation tasks. 4.1 Experimental Setting We selected corpora LDC2003E14, LDC2004T07, LDC2005T06, LDC2005T10 and a portion of data from the corpus LDC2004T08 (Hong Kong Hansards/Laws/News) as our bilingual training data, where document boundaries are explicitly kept.

      "These results strongly suggest that the dynamic and topic cache are very helpful and able to improve translation quality in document translation. Effect of the Gating Mechanism In order to validate the effectiveness of the gating mechanism used in the cache-based neural model, we set a \ufb01xed gate value for RNNSearch\u2217+Cd,Ct, in other words, we use a mixture of probabilities with \ufb01xed proportions to replace the gating mechanism that automatically learns weights for probability mixture. Table 2 displays the result. When we set the gate \u03b1 to a \ufb01xed value 0.3, the performance has an obvious decline comparing with that of RNNSearch\u2217+Cd,Ct in terms of BLEU score. The performance is even worse than RNNSearch* by 10.11 BLEU points. Therefore without a good mechanism, the cache-based neural model cannot be appropriately integrated into NMT. This shows that the gating mechanism plays a important role in RNNSearch\u2217+Cd,Ct. 3As our model requires document boundaries so as to gurantee that cache words are from the same document, we use all LDC corpora that provide document boundaries.",

Most training sentences are from Hong Kong Hansards/Laws Parallel Text (accounting for 57.82% of our training data) which are in the law domain rather than the news domain of our test/dev sets. This is the reason that our baseline is lower than other published results obtained using more news-domain training data without document boundaries.",

      "Reference represents the average number of words in four human translations that are also in the topic cache. Effect of the Topic Cache When the NMT decoder translates the \ufb01rst sentence of a document, the dynamic cache is empty. In this case, we hope that the topic cache will provide document-level information for translating the \ufb01rst sen- tence. We therefore further investigate how the topic cache in\ufb02uence the translation of the \ufb01rst sentence in a document. We count and calculate the average number of words that appear in both the translations of the beginning sentences of documents and the topic cache. The statistical results are shown in Table 3. Without using the cache model, RNNSearch* generates translations that contain words from the topic cache as these topic words are tightly related to documents being translated. With the topic cache, our neural cache model enables the translations of the \ufb01rst sen- tences to be more relevant to the global topics of documents being translated as these translations contain more words from the topic cache that describes these documents. As the dynamic cache is empty when the decoder translates the beginning sentences, the topic cache is complementary to such a cold cache at the start.",
      "As the dynamic cache is empty when the decoder translates the beginning sentences, the topic cache is complementary to such a cold cache at the start. Comparing the numbers of translations generated by our model and human translations (Ref- erence in Table 3), we can \ufb01nd that with the help of the topic cache, translations of the \ufb01rst sentences of documents are becoming closer to human translations. Analysis on the Cache-based Neural Model As shown above, the topic cache is able to in\ufb02uence both the translations of beginning sentences and those of subsequent sentences while the dynamic cache built from translations of preceding sentences has an impact on the translations of subsequent sentences. We further study what roles the dynamic and topic cache play in the translation process. For this aim, we calculate the average number of words in translations generated by RNNSearch\u2217+Cd,Ct that are also in the caches. During the counting process, stop words and \u201cUNK\u201d are removed from sentence and document translations. Table 4 shows the results.",

During the counting process, stop words and \u201cUNK\u201d are removed from sentence and document translations. Table 4 shows the results. If only the topic cache is used ([document \u2208[Ct],sentence \u2208(Ct)] in Table 4), the cache still can provide useful information to help NMT translate sentences and documents. 28.3 words per document and 2.39 words per sentence are from the topic cache. When both the dynamic and topic cache are used ([document \u2208[Ct, Cd],sentence \u2208(Ct, Cd)] in Table 4), the numbers of words that both occur in sentence/document translations and the two caches sharply increase from 2.61/30.27 to 6.73/81.16. The reason for this is that words appear in preceding sentences will have a large probability of appearing in subsequent sentences. This shows that the dynamic cache plays a important role in keeping document translations consistent by reusing words from preceding sentences. We also provide two translation examples in Table 5.",

We use a gating mechanism to integrate both the topic and dynamic cache into the proposed neural cache model. Experiment results show that the cache- based neural model achieves consistent and signi\ufb01cant improvements in translation quality over several state-of-the-art NMT and SMT baselines. Further analysis reveals that the topic cache and dynamic cache are complementary to each other and that both are able to guide the NMT decoder to use topical words and to reuse words from recently translated sentences as next word predictions. 4http://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 5https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T13",
