The practice of fact-checking won\u2019t suf\ufb01ce to eliminate the biases in text data we observe, as the degree of factuality alone does not determine whether biases exist in the spectrum of opinions visi- ble to us. To better understand controversial issues, one needs to view them from a diverse yet comprehensive set of perspectives. For example, there are many ways to respond to a claim such as \u201canimals should have law- ful rights\u201d, and these responses form a spec- trum of perspectives, each with a stance rel- ative to this claim and, ideally, with evidence supporting it. Inherently, this is a natural lan- guage understanding task, and we propose to address it as such.",
            "Inherently, this is a natural lan- guage understanding task, and we propose to address it as such. Speci\ufb01cally, we propose the task of substantiated perspective discov- ery where, given a claim, a system is expected to discover a diverse set of well-corroborated perspectives that take a stance with respect to the claim. Each perspective should be substan- tiated by evidence paragraphs which summa- rize pertinent results and facts. We construct PERSPECTRUM, a dataset of claims, perspectives and evidence, making use of online debate websites to create the ini- tial data collection, and augmenting it using search engines in order to expand and diver- sify our dataset. We use crowdsourcing to \ufb01lter out noise and ensure high-quality data. Our dataset contains 1k claims, accompanied by pools of 10k and 8k perspective sentences and evidence paragraphs, respectively. We provide a thorough analysis of the dataset to highlight key underlying language understand- ing challenges, and show that human baselines across multiple subtasks far outperform ma- chine baselines built upon state-of-the-art NLP techniques.",

This poses a challenge and an op- portunity for the NLP community to address. Figure 1: Given a claim, a hypothetical system is ex- pected to discover various perspectives that are sub- stantiated with evidence and their stance with respect to the claim. 1 Introduction Understanding most nontrivial claims requires in- sights from various perspectives. Today, we make use of search engines or recommendation systems to retrieve information relevant to a claim, but this process carries multiple forms of bias. In particu- lar, they are optimized relative to the claim (query) presented, and the popularity of the relevant doc- uments returned, rather than with respect to the diversity of the perspectives presented in them or whether they are supported by evidence. In this paper, we explore an approach to miti- gating this selection bias (Heckman, 1979) when studying (disputed) claims.",

            "imals to support\/oppose the claim. Alternatively, one can base an argument on morality and ra- tionality of animals, or lack thereof. Each of these arguments, which we refer to as perspectives throughout the paper, is an opinion, possibly con- ditional, in support of a given claim or against it. A perspective thus constitutes a particular attitude towards a given claim. Natural language understanding is at the heart of developing an ability to identify diverse per- spectives for claims. In this work, we propose and study a setting that would facilitate discovering di- verse perspectives and their supporting evidence with respect to a given claim. Our goal is to iden- tify and formulate the key NLP challenges under- lying this task, and develop a dataset that would allow a systematic study of these challenges. For example, for the claim in Figure 1, multiple (non- redundant) perspectives should be retrieved from a pool of perspectives; one of them is \u201canimals have no interest or rationality\u201d, a perspective that should be identi\ufb01ed as taking an opposing stance with respect to the claim. Each perspective should also be well-supported by evidence found in a pool of potential pieces of evidence.",
            "Each perspective should also be well-supported by evidence found in a pool of potential pieces of evidence. While it might be impractical to provide an exhaustive spectrum of ideas with respect to a claim, presenting a small but diverse set of perspectives could be an im- portant step towards addressing the selection bias problem. Moreover, it would be impractical to de- velop an exhaustive pool of evidence for all per- spectives, from a diverse set of credible sources. We are not attempting to do that. We aim at for- mulating the core NLP problems, and developing a dataset that will facilitate studying these problems from the NLP angle, realizing that using the out- comes of this research in practice requires address- ing issues such as trustworthiness (Pasternack and Roth, 2010, 2013) and possibly others. Inherently, our objective requires understanding the relations between perspectives and claims, the nuances in the meaning of various perspectives in the context of claims, and relations between perspectives and evidence. This, we argue, can be done with a di- verse enough, but not exhaustive, dataset.",

            "2 Design Principles and Challenges In this section we provide a closer look into the challenge and propose a collection of tasks that move us closer to substantiated perspective dis- covery. To clarify our description we use to fol- lowing notation. Let c indicate a target claim of interest (for example, the claims c1 and c2 in Fig- ure 2). Each claim c is addressed by a collection of perspectives {p} that are grouped into clusters of equivalent perspectives. Additionally, each per- spective p is supported, relative to c, by at least one evidence paragraph e, denoted e \u22a8p|c. Creating systems that would address our chal- lenge in its full glory requires solving the follow- ing interdependent tasks: Determination of argue-worthy claims: not every claim requires an in-depth discussion of perspec- tives. For a system to be practical, it needs to be equipped with understanding argumentative struc- tures (Palau and Moens, 2009) in order to discern disputed claims from those with straightforward responses. We set aside this problem in this work and assume that all the inputs to the systems are discussion-worthy claims.",
            "We set aside this problem in this work and assume that all the inputs to the systems are discussion-worthy claims. Discovery of pertinent perspectives: a sys- tem is expected to recognize argumentative sen- tences (Cabrio and Villata, 2012) that directly ad- dress the points raised in the disputed claim. For example, while the perspectives in Figure 2 are topically related to the claims, p1, p2 do not di- rectly address the focus of claim c2 (i.e., \u201cuse of animals\u201d in \u201centertainment\u201d). Perspective equivalence: a system is expected to extract a minimal and diverse set of perspec- tives. This requires the ability to discover equiv- alent perspectives p, p\u2032, with respect to a claim c: p|c \u2248p \u2032|c. For instance, p3 and p4 are equiva- lent in the context of c2; however, they might not be equivalent with respect to any other claim. The conditional nature of perspective equivalence dif- ferentiates it from the paraphrasing task (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",

Substantiating the perspectives: a system is ex- pected to \ufb01nd valid evidence paragraph(s) in sup- port of each perspective.

The problem has gained signi\ufb01cant at- tention in the recent years; to note a few impor- tant ones, Hasan and Ng (2014) create a dataset of dataset text snippets, annotated with \u201creasons\u201d (similar to perspectives in this work) and stances (whether they support or oppose the claim).

We use crowdsourcing to annotate different as- pects of the dataset. We used Amazon Mechan- ical Turk (AMT) for our annotations, restricting the task to workers in \ufb01ve English-speaking coun- tries (USA, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Aus- tralia), more than 1000 \ufb01nished HITs and at least a 95% acceptance rate. To ensure the diversity of responses, we do not require additional quali\ufb01ca- tions or demographic information from our anno- tators. For any of the annotations steps described be- low, the users are guided to an external platform where they \ufb01rst read the instructions and try a ver- i\ufb01cation step to make sure they have understood the instructions. Only after successful completion are they allowed to start the annotation tasks.",

Throughout our annotations, it is our aim to make sure that the workers are responding objec- tively to the tasks (as opposed to using their per- sonal opinions or preferences). The screen-shots of the annotation interfaces for each step are in- cluded in the Appendix (Section A.3). In the steps outlined below, we \ufb01lter out a subset of the data with low rater\u2013rater agreement \u03c1 (see Appendix A.2). In certain steps, we use an infor- mation retrieval (IR) system2 to generate the best candidates for the task at hand. Step 1: The initial data collection. We start by crawling the content of a few notable debat- ing websites: idebate.com, debatewise.org, procon.org.",
            "Step 1: The initial data collection. We start by crawling the content of a few notable debat- ing websites: idebate.com, debatewise.org, procon.org. This yields \u223c1k claims, \u223c8k per- spectives and \u223c8k evidence paragraphs (for com- plete statistics, see Table 4 in the Appendix). This data is signi\ufb01cantly noisy and lacks the structure we would like. In the following steps we explain how we denoise it and augment it with additional data. Step 2a: Perspective veri\ufb01cation. For each per- spective we verify that it is a complete English sentence, with a clear stance with respect to the given claim. For a \ufb01xed pair of claim and perspec- tive, we ask the crowd-workers to label the per- spective with one of the \ufb01ve categories of support, oppose, mildly-support, mildly-oppose, or not a valid perspective. The reason that we ask for two levels of intensity is to distinguish mild or condi- tional arguments from those that express stronger positions.",
            "The reason that we ask for two levels of intensity is to distinguish mild or condi- tional arguments from those that express stronger positions. Every 10 claims (and their relevant perspec- tives) are bundled to form a HIT. Three indepen- dent annotators solve a HIT, and each gets paid $1.5-2 per HIT. To get rid of the ambiguous\/noisy perspectives we measure rater-rater agreement on the resulting data and retain only the subset which has a signi\ufb01cant agreement of \u03c1 \u22650.5. To ac- count for minor disagreements in the intensity of 2www.elastic.co",
            "perspective stances, before measuring any notion of agreement, we collapse the \ufb01ve labels into three labels, by collapsing mildly-support and mildly- oppose into support and oppose, respectively. To assess the quality of these annotations, two of the authors independently annotate a random subset of instances in the previous step (328 per- spectives for 10 claims). Afterwards, the differ- ences were adjudicated. We measure the accuracy adjudicated results with AMT annotations to esti- mate the quality of our annotation. This results in an accuracy of 94%, which shows high-agreement with the crowdsourced annotations. Step 2b: Perspective paraphrases. To enrich the ways the perspectives are phrased, we crowd- source paraphrases of our perspectives. We ask annotators to generate two paraphrases for each of the 15 perspectives in each HIT, for a reward of $1.50. Subsequently, we perform another round of crowdsourcing to verify the generated para- phrases. We create HITs of 24 candidate para- phrases to be veri\ufb01ed, with a reward of $1.",

Step 2c: Web perspectives. In order to ensure that our dataset contains more realistic sentences, we use web search to augment our pool of perspec- tives with additional sentences that are topically related to what we already have. Speci\ufb01cally, we use Bing search to extract sentences that are simi- lar to our current pool of perspectives, by querying \u201cclaim+perspective\u201d.

Let P(c) denote the collection of relevant perspectives to a claim c, which is the union of all the equivalent perspectives participating in the claim: {[[pi]]}i. Let E([[p]]) = E(p) = S i ei denote the set of evi- dence documents lending support to a perspective p. Additionally, denote the two pools of perspec- tives and evidence with Up and Ue, respectively. 5.1 Systems We make use of the following systems in our eval- uation: IR (Information Retrieval). This baseline has been successfully used for related tasks like Ques- tion Answering (Clark et al., 2016). We create two versions of this baseline: one with the pool of per- spectives Up and one with the pool of evidences Ue. We use this system to retrieve a ranked list of best matching perspective\/evidence from the cor- responding index. BERT (Contextual representations).",

We use this system to retrieve a ranked list of best matching perspective\/evidence from the cor- responding index. BERT (Contextual representations). A recent state-of-the-art contextualized representation (De- vlin et al., 2018). This system has been shown to be effective on a broad range of natural language understanding tasks. Human Performance. Human performance provides us with an estimate of the best achievable results on datasets. We use human annotators to measure human performance for each task. We randomly sample 10 claims from the test set, and instruct two expert annotators to solve each of T1 to T4. 5.2 Evaluation metrics. We perform evaluations on four different subtasks in our dataset. In all of the following evaluations, the systems are given the two pools of perspectives Up and evidences Ue. T1: Perspective extraction. A system is ex- pected to return the collection of mutually disjoint perspectives with respect to a given claim. Let \u02c6P(c) be the set of output per- spectives.",

T2: Perspective stance classi\ufb01cation. Given a claim, a system is expected to label every perspec- tive in P(c) with one of two labels support or op- pose. We use the well-established de\ufb01nitions of precision-recall for this binary classi\ufb01cation task. T3: Perspective equivalence. A system is ex- pected to decide whether two given perspectives are equivalent or not, with respect to a given claim. We evaluate this task in a way similar to a cluster- ing problem. For a pair of perspectives p1, p2 \u2208 P(c), a system predicts whether the two are in the same cluster or not. The ground-truth is whether there is a cluster which contains both of the per- spectives or not: \u2203\u02dcp s.t. \u02dcp \u2208P(c) \u2227p1, p2 \u2208[[\u02dcp]].",

We use this pairwise de\ufb01nition for all the pairs in P(c) \u00d7 P(c), for any claim c in the test set. T4: Extraction of supporting evidences.

            "The metrics are averaged across all the perspectives p partici- pating in the test set. T5: Overall performance. The goal is to get estimates of the overall performance of the sys- tems. Instead of creating a complex measure that would take all the aspects into account, we approx- imate the overall performance by multiplying the disjoint measures in T1, T2 and T4. While this gives an estimate on the overall quality, it ignores the pipeline structure of the task (e.g., the propa- gation of the errors throughout the pipeline). We note that the task of T3 (perspective equivalence) is indirectly being measured within T1. Further- more, since we do not report an IR performance on T2, we use the \u201calways supp\u201d baseline instead to estimate an overall performance for IR. 5.3 Results 5.3.1 Minimal perspective extraction (T1) Table 3 shows a summary of the experimental re- sults. To measure the performance of the IR sys- tem, we use the index containing Up. Given each claim, we query the top k perspectives, ranked ac-",
            "cording to their retrieval scores. We tune k on our development set and report the results on the test section according to the tuned parameter. We use IR results as candidates for other solvers (includ- ing humans). For this task, IR with top-15 can- didates yields >90% recall (for the PR-curve, see Figure 6 in the Appendix). In order to train BERT on this task, we use the IR candidates as the train- ing instances. We then tune a threshold on the dev data to select the top relevant perspectives. In or- der to measure human performance, we create an interface where two human annotators see IR top- k and select a minimal set of perspectives (i.e., no two equivalent perspectives). 5.3.2 Perspective stance classi\ufb01cation (T2) We measure the quality of perspective stance clas- si\ufb01cation, where the input is a claim-perspective pair, mapped to {support, oppose}.",
            "5.3.2 Perspective stance classi\ufb01cation (T2) We measure the quality of perspective stance clas- si\ufb01cation, where the input is a claim-perspective pair, mapped to {support, oppose}. The can- didate inputs are generated on the collection of perspectives P(c) relevant to a claim c. To have an understanding of a lower bound for the met- ric, we measure the quality of an always-support baseline. We measure the performance of BERT on this task as well, which is about 20% below human performance. This might be because this task requires a deep understanding of common- sense knowledge\/reasoning (as indicated earlier in Section 5). Since a retrieval system is unlikely to distinguish perspectives with different stances, we do not report the IR performance for this task. 5.3.3 Perspective equivalence (T3) We create instances in the form of (p1, p2, c) where p1, p2 \u2208P(c). The expected label is whether the two perspectives belong to the same equivalence class or not.",

The expected label is whether the two perspectives belong to the same equivalence class or not. In the experiments, we observe that BERT has a signi\ufb01cant performance gain of \u223c36% over the IR baseline. Meanwhile, this system is behind human performance by a margin of \u223c20%. 5.3.4 Extraction of supporting evidence (T4) We evaluate the systems on the extraction of items from the pool of evidences Ue, given a claim- perspective pair. To measure the performance of the IR system working with the index con- taining Ue we issue a query containing the con- catenation of a perspective-claim pair. Given the sorted results (according to their retrieval con\ufb01- dence score), we select the top candidates using a threshold parameter tuned on the dev set. We Setting Target set System Pre. Rec.

            "We train BERT system to map each (gold) claim-perspective pair to its corre- sponding evidence paragraph(s). Since each evi- dence paragraph could be long (hence hard to feed into BERT), we split each evidence paragraph into sliding windows of 3 sentences. For each claim- perspective pair, we use all 3-sentences windows of gold evidence paragraphs as positive examples, and rest of the IR candidates as negative examples. In the run-time, if a certain percentage (tuned on the dev set) of the sentences from a given evidence paragraph are predicted as positive by BERT, we consider the whole evidence as positive (i.e. it sup- ports a given perspective). Overall, the performances on this task are lower, which could probably be expected, considering the length of the evidence paragraphs. Similar to the previous scenarios, the BERT solver has a signif- icant gain over a trivial baseline, while standing behind human with a signi\ufb01cant margin. 6 Discussion As one of the key consequences of the informa- tion revolution, information pollution and over- personalization have already had detrimental ef- fects on our life.",
            "6 Discussion As one of the key consequences of the informa- tion revolution, information pollution and over- personalization have already had detrimental ef- fects on our life. In this work, we attempt to facil-",
            "itate the development of systems that aid in better organization and access to information, with the hope that the access to more diverse information can address over-personalization too (Vydiswaran et al., 2014). The dataset presented here is not intended to be exhaustive, nor does it attempt to re\ufb02ect a true dis- tribution of the important claims and perspectives in the world, or to associate any of the perspec- tive and identi\ufb01ed evidence with levels of exper- tise and trustworthiness. Moreover, it is impor- tant to note that when we ask crowd-workers to evaluate the validity of perspectives and evidence, their judgement process can potentially be in\ufb02u- enced by their prior beliefs (Markovits and Nantel, 1989). To avoid additional biases introduced in the process of dataset construction, we try to take the least restrictive approach in \ufb01ltering dataset con- tent beyond the necessary quality assurances. For this reason, we choose not to explicitly ask anno- tators to \ufb01lter contents based on the intention of their creators (e.g. offensive content).",
            "For this reason, we choose not to explicitly ask anno- tators to \ufb01lter contents based on the intention of their creators (e.g. offensive content). A few algorithmic components were not ad- dressed in this work, although they are important to the complete perspective discovery and presen- tation pipeline. For instance, one has to \ufb01rst verify that the input to the system is a reasonably well- phrased and an argue-worthy claim. And, to con- struct the pool of perspectives, one has to extract relevant arguments (Levy et al., 2014). In a similar vein, since our main focus is the study of the rela- tions between claims, perspectives, and evidence, we leave out important issues such as their degree of factuality (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014) or trust- worthiness (Pasternack and Roth, 2014, 2010) as separate aspects of problem. We hope that some of these challenges and lim- itations will be addressed in future work.",
            "We hope that some of these challenges and lim- itations will be addressed in future work. 7 Conclusion The importance of this work is three-fold; we de- \ufb01ne the problem of substantiated perspective dis- covery and characterize language understanding tasks necessary to address this problem. We com- bine online resources, web data and crowdsourc- ing and create a high-quality dataset, in order to drive research on this problem. Finally, we build and evaluate strong baseline supervised systems for this problem. Our hope is that this dataset would bring more attention to this important prob- lem and would speed up the progress in this direc- tion. There are two aspects that we defer to future work. First, the systems designed here assumed that the input are valid claim sentences. To make use of such systems, one needs to develop mecha- nisms to recognize valid argumentative structures. In addition, we ignore trustworthiness and credi- bility issues, important research issues that are ad- dressed in other works.",

            "A.2 Measure of agreement We use the following de\ufb01nition formula in calcula- tion of our measure of agreement. For a \ufb01xed sub- ject (problem instance), let nj represent the num- ber of raters who assigned the given subject to the j-th category. The measure of agreement is de- \ufb01ned as \u03c1 \u225c 1 n(n \u22121) k X j=1 nj(nj \u22121) where for n = Pk j=1 nj. Intuitively, this func- tion measure concentration of values the vector (n1, ..., nk). Take the edge cases: \u2022 Values concentrated: \u2203j, nj = n (in other words \u2200i \u0338= j, ni = 0) \u21d2P = 1.0. \u2022 Least concentration (uniformly distribution): n1 = n2 = ... = nk \u21d2\u03c1 = 0.0. This de\ufb01nition is used in calculation of more extensive agreement measures (e.g, Fleiss\u2019 kappa (Fleiss and Cohen, 1973)).",

There multiple ways of interpreting this formula: Figure 6: Candidates retrieved from IR baselines vs Precision, Recall, F1, for T1 and T4 respectively. \u2022 It indicates how many rater\u2013rater pairs are in agreement, relative to the number of all pos- sible rater\u2013rater pairs. \u2022 One can interpret this measure by a simple combinatorial notions. Suppose we have sets A1, ...Ak which are pairwise disjunct and for each j let nj = |Aj|. We choose randomly two elements from A = A1 \u222aA2 \u222a... \u222aAk. Then the probability that they are from the same set is the expressed by \u03c1.",
